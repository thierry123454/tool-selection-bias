 
Okay, the user is asking about the language of the sentence "Merhaba, bugün nasılsın?". Let me think. First, I need to determine which tool to use. The available functions include several language detection tools. 

The sentence given is in Turkish. I remember that "Merhaba" means "Hello" in Turkish. So the language is likely Turkish. But I need to confirm using one of the tools.

Looking at the tools, the 'what_s_language' function's subfunction 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' can detect the language code. Another option is 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' which also detects language. 

I can use either. Let me pick 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' since it's designed for detecting language in text. The parameters require the text input. 

So, I'll call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the text "Merhaba, bugün nasılsın?". The expected result should be 'tr' for Turkish. Once confirmed, I can present the answer.
