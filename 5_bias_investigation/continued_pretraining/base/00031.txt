 
Okay, the user is asking what language the sentence 'אני לומד עברית' is in. Let me think about the tools I have. There are several language detection functions available. The sentence is in Hebrew, but I need to confirm using the tools.

First, I can use the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function. That tool detects the language of the text. The parameters require the text input. The example given mentions detecting the language even if unknown. So I'll call that function with the provided sentence.

Alternatively, other tools like 'what_s_language' or 'quick_language_detector' might also work, but since the user's sentence is in Hebrew, which is a less common language, the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' might be more reliable. Let me try that first. If it fails, I can try another tool.
