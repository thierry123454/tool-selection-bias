 

Okay, I need to determine the language of the text '今日はとても暑いです。'. Let me see which tools I have available. There are several language detection functions. The user provided a list of subfunctions. Let me check each one.

First, the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function can detect the language. The parameters require a text input. The example mentions detecting the language if unknown. That seems suitable. Another option is 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language', which returns the language code. 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' gives a confidence score. 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another option. 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' also detects language. 

The text given is '今日はとても暑いです。' which looks like Japanese. But I should use the tools to confirm. Let me pick one of the functions. Maybe start with 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' since it's straightforward. The parameters need the text. So I'll call that function with the provided text. If it returns Japanese, then that's the answer. If not, I might need to try another tool. But since the user wants the language detected, and the text is clearly Japanese, the function should identify it. Let's proceed with that.
