 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the text 'Привет, как дела?'. Let me see which tools I can use. There are several language detection functions available. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should pick the most appropriate one.

First, the text is in Russian. The characters are Cyrillic, so it's likely Russian. But I should confirm using the tools. Let me check the available functions. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function seems suitable because it's designed for detecting the language of a text. Another option is 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' which also detects the language code. Alternatively, 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another option. 

I should start by using one of these functions. Let me choose 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' since it's specifically for detecting the language. The parameters require the text, so I'll input 'Привет, как дела?' into that function. Once I get the result, it should return the detected language. If it's Russian, then that's the answer. If not, I might need to try another tool. But given the text, Russian is the most probable. Let's proceed with that.

Action Input:

{
  "text": "Привет, как дела?"
} 

Thought:
The result from the detect_for_translate_all_languages function should indicate the detected language. Since the text is in Russian, the response should confirm that. If it does, then the task is complete. If there's an error or it's not detected correctly, I may need to use another tool like 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' or 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' to cross-verify. But given the input, Russian is the expected outcome.

Action Input:

{
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian (ru)."
} 

Thought:
The task is complete as the language has been successfully detected. The final answer is ready to be provided.
