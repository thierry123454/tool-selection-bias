 
Okay, I need to figure out the language of the text 'Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;'. Let me start by looking at the available tools. There are several language detection functions. The first thing I should do is check which of these tools can accurately detect the language. The text given is in Greek, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me try using the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' function. That's the first subfunction listed, and it's designed for language detection. I'll input the text there and see what it returns. If it doesn't work, I can try another tool like 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' or 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language'. But since I'm not certain, I should start with the first one and see the result.
Thought:
Action
Action Input: {"text": "Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;"}

Okay, the result from the first tool was 'el' which stands for Greek. That makes sense because the text is in Greek. So the language detected is Greek. Now I need to confirm if this is correct. Let me check with another tool to be sure. I can use 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' to cross-verify. If both tools give the same result, then I can be confident. But since the first one already detected it as Greek, and the text is clearly in Greek, I think that's the correct answer. I should then call the Finish function with the result.
Thought:
Action
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;' is Greek (el)."} 

Wait, but I should make sure that the first tool's result is reliable. Let me check with another method. The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' tool might give a confidence score. Let me use that to confirm. If the confidence is high, then the answer is correct. Alternatively, I can use 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' as another check. However, since the first tool already detected it as Greek, and the text is clearly in Greek, I think it's safe to conclude. But to be thorough, maybe I should check with another tool. Let me use 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' with the text and see if
