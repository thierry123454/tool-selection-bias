 

Okay, the user is asking for the language of the phrase "Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?". Let me think about the tools available. There are several language detection functions. I need to choose the most appropriate one. The phrase is in German, so I should check which tool can accurately detect that.

First, the 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' might work, but I'm not sure about its accuracy. The 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another option. The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' seems straightforward. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' is also a possibility. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' could be another choice. 

Since the phrase is short, maybe the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is best. Let me try that first. If it doesn't work, I can try another tool. I'll call the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' function with the text "Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?".
Thought:
I need to determine the language of the given text. The phrase "Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?" is in German. I'll use the fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3 function to check.

Action
fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input:
{"text": "Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?"}I need to determine the language of the given text. The phrase "Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?" is in German. I'll use the fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3 function to check.

Action
fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input:
{"text": "Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?"}

The function returned "de" as the detected language code, which corresponds to German. Now I can confirm that the language is German and provide the answer.
Thought:
The detected language code is "de", which stands for German. The task is complete.
