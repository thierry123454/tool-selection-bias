 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the text 'Hej, hur mår du idag?'. Let me see which tool to use. The user provided several functions. Let me check each one.

First, 'what_s_language' has a subfunction 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' that detects the language code. The text is in Swedish, so maybe that's the right tool. Alternatively, 'quick_language_detector' has 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' which gives confidence scores. 'text_language_by_api_ninjas' has 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' which is straightforward. 'translate_v3' has 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' which might work. 'translate_all_languages' has 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' which also detects language.

I should pick the most reliable one. Let me try 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' first. The text is 'Hej, hur mår du idag?', which is Swedish. Let me call that function with the text. If it returns 'sv' as the code, that's correct. If not, maybe try another tool. But I should start with the first one.
