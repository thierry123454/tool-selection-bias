 

Okay, I need to identify the language of the sentence 'Привет, как дела?'. Let me see which tools I have available. There are several functions for language detection. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should choose the most appropriate one.

First, the sentence is in Russian. I remember that 'Привет' means 'Hello' in Russian. But I need to confirm using the tools. Let me check each function's description. 

The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function seems suitable because it's designed for detecting the language of a text. The parameters require the text input. The example value mentions detecting languages even if unknown, which fits here. 

Alternatively, 'what_s_language' also detects the language code. But since the user might want the detected language name, maybe 'translate_all_languages' is better. Wait, the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' is the subfunction for that tool. Let me use that. 

I'll call 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' with the text 'Привет, как дела?'. The expected result should be Russian. If it works, I can then use the Finish function to provide the answer. If not, maybe try another tool.
