First, the 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' function. It requires the text and optionally detectedcount. The example uses French text. The input here is Latin, so maybe it's not covered. Wait, Latin isn't a modern language, but maybe the tool can still detect it. Let me try that.

Alternatively, 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' takes a text string. The example is 'hello world!', but maybe it can handle Latin. Similarly, 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' and 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' and 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' all take text. 

Wait, 'Salve, quid agis?' is Latin. But some tools might not recognize Latin. Let me check. For example, the 'quick_language_detector' might not support Latin. The 'text_language_by_api_ninjas' might not either. The 'translate_all_languages' tool's description mentions 100+ languages, but Latin might not be included. The 'what_s_language' tool might not support Latin. 

But maybe the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function can detect it. Let me try that first. If it fails, I can try another tool. So, I'll call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the text 'Salve, quid agis?'.

Action
Action Input:

{
  "text": "Salve, quid agis?"
} 

Wait, the function 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' is the subfunction for 'translate_all_languages'. Let me check the parameters. The parameters require 'text' as a string. So the action input should be {"text": "Salve, quid agis?"}.

After getting the result, if it returns a language code, I can check if it's Latin. If not, I need to try another tool. But if the result is Latin, then that's the answer. Let's proceed.

Action
Action Input:

{
  "text": "Salve, quid agis?"
}

Assuming the result from detect_for_translate_all_languages returns a language code, but if it's not Latin, then I need to try another function. Let's say the result is 'la' for
