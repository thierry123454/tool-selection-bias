 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the text 'Привет, как дела?'. Let me see which tools are available. There are several functions for language detection. The user provided a list of subfunctions. Let me check each one.

First, the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' function is part of translate_v3. The description says it returns the language of the text. The parameters require a text input. The example value is in English, but the function should handle other languages.

Another option is 'detect_for_translate_all_languages', which is part of translate_all_languages. It also detects the language, and the example mentions handling unknown languages. The parameters take a text input, and the example uses a sentence about not knowing the language. That might be useful here.

Then there's 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language', which returns the detected language code. The parameters are similar, requiring text input. The example is in English, but the function should work for other languages.

The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' function takes text and an optional detectedcount. The example uses French text, so it should handle Cyrillic as well. This might be a good choice since it's designed for detecting languages from text samples.

Lastly, 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another option. The example uses 'hello world!', but the function should work for any text. 

Since the user's text is in Cyrillic, I need to ensure the function can handle Cyrillic scripts. The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' function's example uses French, but the description mentions it can detect 52 languages, including Cyrillic. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' function also seems suitable. 

I should pick one of these functions. Let's start with 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' because it's designed for detecting languages from text samples and can handle multiple languages. The parameters require the text, which is 'Привет, как дела?', and optionally detectedcount. Since the text is short, maybe the default is sufficient. 

Alternatively, 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' might be simpler. Let me check the parameters again. Both functions require the text input. Let's go with 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' as it's designed for this purpose. 

Wait, the user's text is in Russian. Let me confirm if the functions can detect Cyrillic. The 'detect_language
