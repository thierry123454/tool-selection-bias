 
Okay, the user is asking what language the text 'مرحبا كيف حالك' is written in. Let me see. First, I need to determine the language of this Arabic text. The available functions include several language detection tools. Let me check each one's description.

The first option is text_language_by_api_ninjas, which detects language. Then there's translate_v3's fast_language_detection, translate_all_languages' detect function, what_s_language's languagedetection, and quick_language_detector's detect_language. All seem suitable. 

Since the text is in Arabic, I should use a function that can handle Arabic. Let me pick one. Maybe the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function from the translate_all_languages tool. Alternatively, 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' or 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3'. 

Wait, the user provided the text 'مرحبا كيف حالك', which is clearly Arabic. But to confirm, I should use one of the detection functions. Let me choose 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' as it's designed for detecting language across many languages. The parameters require the text. So I'll call that function with the given text. 

After getting the result, if it correctly identifies Arabic, then I can confirm. If not, maybe try another function. But since the text is clearly Arabic, the result should be straightforward. Let's proceed with that.
