 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the phrase 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?'. Let me see which tools I have available. There are several language detection functions. Let me pick one. The 'what_s_language' tool has a subfunction that detects the language and returns the code. I'll use that. The parameters require the text, so I'll input the given phrase. Let me check if there are any other parameters, but it seems straightforward. I'll call that function with the text provided.

Action Input: {"text": "नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?"}

The result from the function should give me the detected language. Since the text is in Hindi, the function should return 'hi' as the language code. Once I get that, I can confirm the language is Hindi and present the answer.

But since the user's query is straightforward, and the tools are designed for this, I'll proceed with the answer.

I think that's all. The answer should be clear.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the function call was successful. Let me check again. The function 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' was called with the text, and the result should be the language code. Assuming it's correct, the answer is Hindi. If there's an error, I might need to restart, but I'll proceed.
