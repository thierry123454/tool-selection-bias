 
Okay, the user is asking to identify the language of the phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'. Let me see which tools I have available for language detection.

First, I notice there are several functions for language detection: text_language_by_api_ninjas, translate_v3, translate_all_languages, what_s_language, and quick_language_detector. Each has its own parameters. The phrase given is in German, so I expect the function to return German.

I should pick one of the functions. Let me check the parameters. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function seems suitable. It takes a text parameter. The example value mentions detecting the language if unknown. The user's phrase is 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?', which is German. Let me call that function with the text input. 

Wait, maybe another function is better. The 'what_s_language' function's subfunction 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' also detects language. Let me use that. The parameters require the text. So I'll input the phrase there. 

Alternatively, the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' function could work. Let me choose one. Let's go with 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' since it's designed for detecting language in the text. 

So, I'll call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the text 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'. The result should indicate German. Once I get the response, I can confirm the language and present the answer.
Thought:
I need to identify the language of the given text. The phrase "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?" is in German. I'll use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to confirm.
