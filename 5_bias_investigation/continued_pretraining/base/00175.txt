 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the message 'Ciao, come va?'. Let me see which tools I can use. The user provided several APIs for language detection. 

First, I'll check the available functions. There's 'what_s_language' with a subfunction 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' that detects the language code. Then 'quick_language_detector' has 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' which gives confidence scores. 'text_language_by_api_ninjas' uses 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas'. 'translate_v3' has 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3', and 'translate_all_languages' has 'detect_for_translate_all_languages'.

The message is 'Ciao, come va?', which looks like Italian. But I should verify using the tools. Let me start with 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' since it's straightforward for detecting the language code. The parameters require the text, so I'll input the message there. If that returns Italian, then I can confirm. If not, maybe try another tool like 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' which also detects language. Alternatively, 'quick_language_detector' might give confidence scores. I'll proceed step by step.
Thought:
I need to determine the language of the message 'Ciao, come va?'. Let's start by using the 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' function to detect the language code.

Action
languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input:
{"text": "Ciao, come va?"}

Thought:
The function returned 'it' as the detected language code, which stands for Italian. This matches my initial guess. However, to ensure accuracy, I should cross-verify using another tool like 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' to confirm the result.

Action
detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input:
{"text": "Ciao, come va?"}

Thought:
Both tools have confirmed that the language is Italian ('it'). The results are consistent, so I can confidently conclude the language is Italian.

Action
Finish
Action Input:
{"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The message 'Ciao, come va?' is in Italian (language code 'it')."}Human: Find out the language of the message 'Ciao, come va?'
