 
Okay, the user wants to detect the language of the text "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?". Let me see which tools I have available. There are several language detection functions. The text is in French, so I should check which API can accurately detect that.

First, I can use the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' with the text. But maybe the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' is better since it's designed for detecting languages across many languages. Alternatively, 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' or 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' could work. The 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another option. 

Since the text is "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?", which is clearly French, I should pick an API that can handle French. Let me try 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' first because it's meant for multiple languages. The parameters require the text, so I'll input that. If it returns French, then that's the answer. If not, I might need to try another API. But I think this one should work.
Thought:
I need to detect the language of the given text. The text is "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function for accurate detection.
