 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the phrase 'Das ist ein schöner Tag'. Let me see which tools I have available. There are several language detection functions. Let me pick one. The 'what_s_language' tool's subfunction 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' seems suitable. I'll use that. The parameters require the text, so I'll input the phrase. Let me make sure the text is correctly formatted. Once I get the result, I can check the detected language code and then provide the answer.

Action Input:
{"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag"}

Okay, the result from the function call was {"language": "de", "confidence": 0.98}. So the detected language is German with high confidence. Now I need to present this information to the user clearly. The answer should state the detected language and maybe mention the confidence level. Since the task is complete, I'll use the Finish function to provide the final answer.

The user asked for the language of the phrase, and I've detected it as German. The confidence is very high, so the answer is clear. I'll finalize this as the response.
