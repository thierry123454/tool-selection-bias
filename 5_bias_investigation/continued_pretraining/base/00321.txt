 

Okay, I need to determine the language of the text '今日はお元気ですか？'. Let me see which tools I can use. The user provided several APIs for language detection. 

First, I'll check the available functions. There's 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' which detects the language. Also, 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' and 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' are options. 

The text given is in Japanese. Let me test one of the functions. I'll start with 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' since it's designed for detecting languages across many supported ones. The parameters require the text, so I'll input '今日はお元気ですか？' there. 

Wait, the function 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' might return the detected language. Let me call that function with the provided text. If it returns Japanese, then that's the answer. If not, I might need to try another function. But since the text is clearly Japanese, this should work.
Thought:
I need to determine the language of the text '今日はお元気ですか？'. I'll use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to identify the language.

Action
detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input:
{"text": "今日はお元気ですか？"}def detect_language(text):
    """Detect the language of the given text using the translate_all_languages API."""
    response = detect_for_translate_all_languages(text=text)
    return response

def main():
    text = "今日はお元気ですか？"
    language = detect_language(text)
    print(f"The language of the text is: {language}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Thought:
The function detect_for_translate_all_languages has been called with the text "今日はお元気ですか？". The response will indicate the detected language.
