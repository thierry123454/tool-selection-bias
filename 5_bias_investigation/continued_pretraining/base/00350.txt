 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the text 'Ciao, come stai?'. Let me see which tools I can use. There are several language detection functions available. Let me pick one. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' seems straightforward. I'll call that with the given text. Wait, the parameters require 'text', so I'll input 'Ciao, come stai?' there. Let me check if there are any other parameters, but it looks like only 'text' is needed. Alright, I'll proceed with that.

Action
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

The result from the function should indicate the detected language. Since the text is in Italian, the response should show Italian as the detected language. Now, I can confirm the language and present the answer.
