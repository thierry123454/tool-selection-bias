 

Okay, the user is asking to detect the language of the text 'Olá, tudo bem?'. Let me see which tools I have available for language detection. There are several functions: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3, detect_for_translate_all_languages, languagedetection_for_what_s_language, detect_language_for_quick_language_detector, and v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas. 

First, I should check which of these functions can handle the given text. The text is in Portuguese, so I expect the function to return 'pt' or similar. Let me pick one of the functions. The detect_for_translate_all_languages seems suitable since it's designed for detecting languages in a text. The parameters require the text input. I'll call that function with the provided text.

Wait, but maybe another function is more accurate. The what_s_language's languagedetection_for_what_s_language might be better. Or the quick_language_detector's detect_language_for_quick_language_detector, which also gives confidence scores. However, the user just needs the detected language, so any of these could work. Let me choose detect_for_translate_all_languages as it's straightforward. 

I'll execute the function with the text 'Olá, tudo bem?' and see the result. If it returns the correct language code, then I can confirm. If not, I might need to try another function. But since the user's query is straightforward, I'll proceed with this step first.

Thought:
I need to translate the text 'Hello, how are you?' into Spanish. First, I should determine the original language of the text to ensure accurate translation. The text is in English, so I'll use the translate_v3 function for translation.

{"text": "Hello, how are you?"}

Okay, the translation result is 'Hola, ¿cómo est
