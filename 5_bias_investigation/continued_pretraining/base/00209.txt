 

Okay, I need to detect the language of the text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다'. Let me see which tools I have available. There are several functions for language detection. The user provided a list of tools, and I can use any of their subfunctions.

First, I should check the available subfunctions. The options are: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3, detect_for_translate_all_languages, languagedetection_for_what_s_language, detect_language_for_quick_language_detector, and v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas. 

The text given is '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다', which looks like Korean. But I need to confirm using one of the tools. Let me pick the most reliable one. The translate_v3's subfunction might be good. Alternatively, the detect_for_translate_all_languages could work. Another option is the what_s_language's subfunction. 

Wait, the translate_v3's subfunction is called fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3. Let me use that first. The parameters require the text. So I'll call that function with the given text. If it returns the language, then I can confirm. If not, I might need to try another tool. 

Alternatively, maybe the detect_for_translate_all_languages is better. But I'll start with the first one. Let me make the call.
