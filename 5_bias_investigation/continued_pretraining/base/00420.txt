 

Okay, the user wants to know the language of the text 'Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;'. Let me see which tools I can use. There are several language detection functions available. Let me pick one. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' seems straightforward. I'll call that with the given text. Wait, the parameters require 'text', so I'll input the Greek phrase. Then, based on the result, I can determine the language. If that doesn't work, I might need to try another tool. But let's start with this one.
Thought:
Action
Action Input: {"text": "Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;"}

The result from the API should indicate the detected language. Greek is likely, but let's confirm. If the response shows 'el' for Greek, then the answer is clear. If there's an error, I'll need to use another tool like 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' or 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' as backups. But assuming the first call works, I can proceed to finalize the answer.

Action Input: {"text": "Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;"}

Wait, I already used the same action input. Maybe the system requires a different approach. Let me check the available functions again. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' might be more accurate. Let me try that next. If the result is 'el', then it's Greek. Otherwise, I'll need to try another method. But since the initial response likely detected Greek, I can then conclude the answer.

Action
Action Input: {"text": "Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;"}

After getting the detection result, I can confirm the language. If all tools agree, I can finalize. If there's inconsistency, maybe the text is in a less common language. But given the phrase, Greek is the most probable. So, I'll proceed to give the answer.
Thought:
Action
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;' is in Greek (language code 'el')."} 

Wait, I need to make sure the final answer is correctly formatted. Let me structure it properly.
