 

Okay, I need to determine the language of the phrase "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?". Let me think about the tools available. There are several language detection functions. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should pick the most appropriate one.

First, the phrase is in German. But I should verify using the tools. Let's check the available functions. The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' might work, but the example uses French. The 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is straightforward. The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is another option. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' and 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' are also possible. 

Since the phrase is "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?", which is clearly German, but to use the tool, I should call one of the functions. Let me choose 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' because it's simple and direct. The parameters require the text, so I'll input the phrase. The result should return German. If it does, then I can confirm the language. If not, maybe try another tool. But given the example values, I think this function should work.
Thought:
I need to determine the language of the given text "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?". The best approach is to use the v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas function, which is designed for detecting the language of a text.

Thought:
The API returned the language code "de" for the input text, which corresponds to German. This confirms the language of the phrase.
