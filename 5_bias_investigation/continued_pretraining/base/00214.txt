 

Okay, I need to determine the language of the sentence "Ciao, come stai oggi?". Let me see which tools I have available. There are several language detection functions. Let me pick one. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' seems straightforward. I'll use that. The parameters require the text, so I'll input the sentence. Wait, the example value mentions detecting if the language is unknown, but here the text is clearly Italian. Let me call the function with the given text.
Thought:
Action
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai oggi?"}

The result from the function should indicate the detected language. Since the sentence is in Italian, the response should show Italian as the detected language. Now, I need to confirm that this is correct. If the function returns Italian, then the task is complete. If not, maybe try another tool. But given the sentence, Italian is the correct answer. So I'll finalize with the detected language.
