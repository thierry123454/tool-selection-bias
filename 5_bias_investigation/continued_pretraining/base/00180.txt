 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the sentence "Hola, ¿cómo estás hoy?". Let me see which tools are available. There are several language detection functions. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should choose the most appropriate one.

First, the sentence is in Spanish. The tools available include quick_language_detector, text_language_by_api_ninjas, translate_v3, translate_all_languages, and what_s_language. Each has a subfunction. Let me check their descriptions.

The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' might be good since it detects multiple languages with confidence scores. The 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another option. The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is straightforward. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' also seems suitable. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' returns a language code.

Since the sentence is in Spanish, I can try any of these. Let me pick 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' because it's simple and direct. The parameters require the text, so I'll input the sentence. Then, the result should indicate Spanish. If that works, I can confirm the answer. If not, I'll try another tool.
