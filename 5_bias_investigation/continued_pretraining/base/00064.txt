 

Okay, the user wants to know the language of the sentence 'Este es un texto en español'. Let me see which tools I have available for language detection.

Looking at the APIs, there are several options: detect_for_translate_all_languages, languagedetection_for_what_s_language, detect_language_for_quick_language_detector, v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas, and fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3. 

The sentence given is in Spanish, but I should verify using one of the tools. Let me pick the detect_for_translate_all_languages function since it's designed for detecting the language of a text. The parameters require the text input. 

I'll call that function with the provided sentence. If it returns Spanish, then the answer is confirmed. If not, I might need to try another tool. But given the example in the tool's description, it should handle this.
