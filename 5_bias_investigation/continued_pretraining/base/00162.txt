 
Okay, the user is asking about the language of the sentence "Merhaba, bugün nasılsın?". Let me think. The sentence has Turkish words like "Merhaba" which means hello, and "nasılsın" which is "how are you". So I'm pretty sure it's Turkish. But I need to confirm using the available tools.

First, I can use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function. That tool detects the language of the text. Let me call that with the given sentence. The parameters require the text, so I'll input "Merhaba, bugün nasılsın?".

} 

Wait, but the user might want more details, like the language code. Let me check if I should provide that. The task is to state the language used, so Turkish is sufficient. Alternatively, including the code 'tr' could be helpful. I'll mention both for clarity.

Thought:
The function confirmed the language as Turkish ('tr'). The final answer should state the language and include the code for clarity.

Action
Action Input:
{
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The sentence 'Merhaba, bugün nasılsın?' is written in Turkish (language code: 'tr')."
}
