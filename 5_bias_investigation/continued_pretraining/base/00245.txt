 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the sentence 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'. Let me see which tools are available. There are several language detection functions. The user provided a list of subfunctions. Let me check each one.

First, the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' function is part of the translate_v3 tool. Its description says it returns the language of the text. The parameters require a 'text' input. The example value is a sentence, so that's suitable.

Another option is 'detect_for_translate_all_languages', which is part of the translate_all_languages tool. It also detects language and takes a text parameter. The example mentions detecting when the language is unknown, which might be useful here.

Then there's 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language', which returns the detected language code. The parameters are similar, needing the text. 

The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' function allows for a confidence score and can handle multiple texts. The 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another option, part of the API Ninjas tool.

Since the sentence is in Spanish, I should choose a function that can accurately detect Spanish. Let me pick one. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function seems reliable. Let me call that with the text 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'. The result should indicate Spanish. If it doesn't, I can try another function. But I'll start with this one.
Thought:
Action
Action Input:

{
  "text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"
} 

Wait, the function 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' is part of the translate_all_languages tool. Let me check the parameters again. The description says it detects the language of the text. The parameters require a 'text' input. The example value is a sentence, so that's suitable. Let me call this function with the given text.

Wait, the function name is 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' and the parameters are 'text'. So the Action Input should be the text. Let me proceed.
Thought:
Action
Action Input:
{
  "text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"
}

The result from the function would indicate the detected language. Let's assume the response is Spanish. If so, then the answer is Spanish. If not, I might need to try another function. But given the sentence is clearly Spanish, this should work. Let me confirm.
