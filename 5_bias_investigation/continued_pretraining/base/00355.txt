 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the text '今日は元気ですか？'. Let me see which tools I can use. There are several language detection functions available. The user provided a list of subfunctions. Let me check each one.

First, the 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' function detects language using the API Ninjas Text Language API. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function is for translating all languages and also detects language. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' checks the language code. The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' uses a quick detector with confidence scores. The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is another option.

The text given is '今日は元気ですか？', which looks like Japanese. But I should verify using the tools. Let me pick one of the functions. Maybe start with 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' since it's designed for detecting language across many languages. The parameters require the text. So I'll call that function with the provided text.
