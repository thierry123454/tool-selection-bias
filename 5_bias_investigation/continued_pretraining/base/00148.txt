 

Okay, I need to determine the language of the text 'Je suis content de te voir'. Let me think about the tools available. There are several language detection functions. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should pick the most appropriate one.

First, the text is in French. But I need to confirm using the tools. Let me check the available functions. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function can detect the language. Another option is 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' or 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3'. 

I should start by using one of these functions. Let me try 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' first. The parameters require the text. So I'll call that function with the given text. If it returns the language, I can then use 'Finish' to provide the answer. If not, I might need to try another tool. But since the text is clearly French, maybe the first call will work.
