 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the sentence 'Это пример текста на русском языке'. Let me see which tool to use. There are several language detection functions available. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should pick the most appropriate one.

First, the sentence is in Russian. The tools include functions like detect_language_for_quick_language_detector, v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas, fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3, detect_for_translate_all_languages, and languagedetection_for_what_s_language. 

I should check each function's description. The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' seems to return confidence scores, which might be useful. The 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is straightforward. The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is also simple. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' might handle multiple texts. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' returns a language code.

Since the input is a single sentence, any of these could work. Let me try one of them. Maybe 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is the most direct. I'll use that function with the given text.
