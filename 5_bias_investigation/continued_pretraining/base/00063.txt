 
Okay, the user is asking for the language of the text '今日はとてもいい天気です'. Let me see. The first thing I need to do is determine which tool to use for language detection. There are several options available. 

The text provided is in Japanese, but I should confirm. The tools include functions like 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3', 'detect_for_translate_all_languages', 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language', 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector', and 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas'. 

I should pick one of these functions. Let me check their descriptions. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function is designed to detect the language of a text, and it's part of the translate_all_languages tool. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' also detects language. Maybe start with 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' since it's straightforward.

Wait, the user's text is '今日はとてもいい天気です', which is clearly Japanese. But to be thorough, I should use a function that can accurately detect it. Let me call 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' with the text as input. That should return the detected language. Once I get the result, I can confirm the language and provide the answer.
