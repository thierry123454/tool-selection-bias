 

Okay, I need to determine the language of the text '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?'. Let me see which tools I can use. There are several language detection functions available. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should pick the most appropriate one.

First, the text is in Korean. But I should verify using the tools. Let me check each function's description. The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' can detect multiple languages with confidence scores. The 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another option. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' also seems suitable. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' returns a language code. 

Since the user's text is in Korean, I should use a tool that can detect it. Let me try 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' first because it's designed for detecting the language of text, and the example mentions handling unknown languages. Alternatively, 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is another option. 

Wait, the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function's description says it detects the language of the text. Let me use that. The parameters require 'text', so I'll input the given text. If it returns Korean, then that's the answer. If not, I might need to try another tool. Let's proceed with that.

The result from the detect_for_translate_all_languages function indicates the detected language is Korean. Therefore, the answer is Korean.
