 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the text '안녕하세요, 만나서 반갑습니다.' Let me see which tools are available. There are several functions: quick_language_detector, text_language_by_api_ninjas, translate_v3, translate_all_languages, and what_s_language. Each has subfunctions. 

First, I should check which subfunctions can detect language. The quick_language_detector's subfunction detects language with confidence scores. The text_language_by_api_ninjas has a subfunction that detects language. Translate_v3's subfunction returns the language. Translate_all_languages' subfunction detects the language. What_s_language's subfunction returns the language code.

The user's text is in Korean. Let me try one of the subfunctions. Maybe start with 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' since it's designed for detecting multiple languages. But the parameters require 'text' and optionally 'detectedcount'. The text is '안녕하세요, 만나서 반갑습니다.' I'll call that function with the text. Wait, but maybe the text is too short? The example value for quick_language_detector's text is in French, but the function might handle Korean. Alternatively, maybe 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' is better. Let me try that first. The parameters need 'text', so I'll input the Korean text. Let me check the subfunctions again. 

Alternatively, the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' subfunction might be suitable. Let me pick one. Let's go with 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' since it's designed for detecting the language of text. The parameters require 'text', so I'll input the Korean text. Let's see the result. If it returns Korean, then that's the answer. If not, try another function. But since the user's text is clearly Korean, I expect it to detect correctly. So I'll proceed with that.

Thought:
The function 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' returned the detected language as 'Korean'. This is the correct result. Now, I should confirm if this is sufficient. Since the task is to detect the language, the answer is Korean. I should call the Finish function with this result.
