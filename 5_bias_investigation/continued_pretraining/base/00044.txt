 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the phrase 'Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?'. Let me think about the tools available. There are several language detection functions. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should pick the most appropriate one.

First, the phrase is in German. But I should verify using the tools. Let me check the functions. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function can detect the language. Alternatively, 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is another option. Both seem suitable. Let me try the first one. 

I'll call 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' with the text 'Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?'. The expected result should be German. If that works, great. If not, I can try another function. Let me proceed.
