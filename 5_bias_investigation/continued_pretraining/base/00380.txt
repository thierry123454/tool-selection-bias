 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the text '今日は元気ですか？'. Let me start by recalling the available functions. There are several language detection tools listed. The user provided a Japanese text, so I should check which function can detect it.

First, the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' function is part of the translate_v3 tool. Its description says it returns the language of the text. The parameters require the text input. Since the text is '今日は元気ですか？', which looks like Japanese, I can use this function. 

Alternatively, there's 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' which also detects language. But maybe the first one is more straightforward. Let me try that. The parameters need the text, so I'll input the given text. 

Wait, the example value for 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is in English, but the function should handle Japanese. Let me make sure I'm using the correct function. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' is another option, but the user's text is in Japanese. The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' might also work, but I need to check if it's necessary. 

Since the user's text is in Japanese, I should use a function that can detect Japanese. The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' might not be the best if it's not designed for Japanese. Let me consider other options. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' is part of the translate_all_languages tool, which is supposed to handle any language, including Japanese. 

But the user's text is short, so maybe the function can still detect it. Let me try that. The parameters for 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' require the text. So I'll input '今日は元気ですか？' and see the result. 

Wait, the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' allows multiple texts, but here it's one. So I'll call that function with the text. If the result is Japanese, then that's the answer. If not, maybe try another function. 

Alternatively, the 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another option. Let me check the parameters. It requires the text, so I can use that as well. 

But since the user's text is in Japanese, I should pick the most reliable function. Let me start with 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' because it's designed for any language. Let's call that function with
