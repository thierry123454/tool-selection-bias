 

Okay, I need to detect the language of the text 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'. Let me see which tools are available. There are several functions for language detection. The user provided a list of subfunctions. Let me check each one.

First, the 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' function is for detecting language using the API Ninjas Text Language API. The parameters require a 'text' input. The example value is 'hello world!', so I can use this function with the given text.

Another option is 'detect_for_translate_all_languages', which is part of the translate_all_languages tool. Its description says it detects the language of the text. The parameters also require a 'text' input. The example mentions detecting the language if unknown, which fits the task.

The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' function is another option. It returns the detected language code. The parameters need the text. The example is 'How to Identify the Language of any Text', so that's applicable here.

The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' function is also available. It detects the language with a confidence score. The parameters include 'text' and an optional 'detectedcount'. The example uses a French sentence, but the text here is Latin, so maybe this function can handle it.

The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' function is part of the translate_v3 tool. It returns the language of the text. The example uses a longer text, but the input here is a short phrase.

Since the user's query is in Latin, I need to check if any of these functions can detect Latin. However, some of these tools might not support Latin. For example, the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' might not recognize Latin as a supported language. The 'quick_language_detector' might have a confidence score, but if it's not in the supported list, it might not detect it. The 'text_language_by_api_ninjas' might also not recognize Latin.

Wait, the user's text is 'Salve, quid agis hodie?', which is Latin. But the functions listed might not support Latin. For example, the 'translate_all_languages' tool's detect function might not include Latin. The 'what_s_language' tool might not support Latin either. The 'quick_language_detector' might not have Latin in its supported languages. The 'text_language_by_api_ninjas' might not detect Latin as a language
