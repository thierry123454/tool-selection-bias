 
Thought: I need to determine the language of the text '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?'. Since this text appears to be in Korean, I will use the appropriate language detection function to confirm.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?"}

Thought: The function returned that the detected language is Korean. I have now identified the language of the text.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?' is in Korean."}
Okay, let's see. The user asked, "What language is the following text: '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?'" I need to figure out which tool to use here. The available functions include several language detection tools. 

First, I notice that the text provided is in Korean. The user is asking for the language, so I should use a language detection function. The options include 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language', 'detect_for_translate_all_languages', 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector', and 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas'. 

I should pick the most appropriate one. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' function seems straightforward for detecting the language code. Let me use that. The parameters require the text, so I'll input the given Korean text. 

After calling that function, it returns the detected language. The result is 'ko' which stands for Korean. So the answer is Korean. Then I need to call the Finish function with the final answer.
