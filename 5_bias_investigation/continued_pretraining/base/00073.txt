 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the sentence "Salve, quid agis hodie?". Let me think about the tools available. There are several language detection functions. Let me check each one.

First, the 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' function. It requires the text and optionally detectedcount. The example uses French, but the input here is Latin. Wait, Latin isn't a supported language for that tool? Maybe not. Let me check other options.

The 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' function takes a text input. The example is "hello world!", but the input here is Latin. However, the API might not support Latin. 

The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' function is for detecting the language of the text. The example uses English. But Latin might not be recognized here either.

The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function is for detecting the language of the text. The example mentions detecting if the language is unknown. But Latin might not be in the supported list. 

The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' function detects the language code. Again, Latin might not be supported. 

Wait, the user's sentence is in Latin. But none of the tools seem to support Latin. The functions might not recognize Latin as a valid language. So, perhaps I need to use one of the tools and see if it returns Latin. Let me try one of them. Let's pick 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' with the text "Salve, quid agis hodie?" and see the result. If it doesn't return Latin, then I'll have to inform the user that the language isn't recognized.
