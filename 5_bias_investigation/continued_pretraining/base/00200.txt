 

Okay, the user is asking what language the text 'Estou aprendendo português' is. Let me figure out which tool to use. There are several language detection functions available. The text is in Portuguese, but I need to confirm.

First, I can use the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' tool. That's designed for detecting the language of a text. The parameters require the text input. Let me call that function with the given text. 

Alternatively, there's 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' which also detects language. But since the user's query is straightforward, the first tool might be sufficient. Let me try that. 

Wait, the text is 'Estou aprendendo português'. The words 'português' clearly indicate Portuguese. But the function might need to process it. Let me use the 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' tool, which returns the language code. 

But maybe the best approach is to use the 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' tool, which also provides confidence scores. However, the user just needs the language name. Let me pick the first tool. 

I'll call 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' with the text. The result should give the detected language. If it's Portuguese, then that's the answer. If not, maybe try another tool. But I think it's Portuguese. Let's proceed.
Thought:
I need to determine the language of the text 'Estou aprendendo português'. The most straightforward approach is to use the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' tool, which is designed for language detection. This will provide the detected language code, which I can then map to the language name.

Action:
fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input:
{"text": "Estou aprendendo português"}Write a function in Python to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n, where n is a positive integer.

To solve this problem, we can use a loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to n and add the even numbers to a running total. Alternatively, we can use a formula to calculate the sum of an arithmetic series of even numbers.

Let's implement the solution using a loop for clarity.

```python
def sum_even_numbers(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(2, n+1, 2):
        total += i
    return total
```

This function works by iterating
