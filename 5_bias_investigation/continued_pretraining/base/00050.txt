 
Okay, the user is asking about the language of the sentence "Merhaba, bugün nasılsın?". Let me think. First, I need to determine which tool to use. There are several language detection functions available. The sentence given is in Turkish, but I should confirm.

Looking at the tools, the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function is designed to detect the language of a text. The parameters require the text input. The example value mentions detecting the language even if unknown. So, I'll use that function with the provided sentence. 

Another option is 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language', which also detects the language code. But since the user just wants the language name, maybe 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' is better. Let me call that function with the text "Merhaba, bugün nasılsın?".
