 

Okay, I need to identify the language of the given text: 'यह एक हिंदी वाक्य है'. Let me see which tool to use. The user provided several functions. Let me check each one.

First, the 'what_s_language' tool has a subfunction 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' that detects the language code. The 'quick_language_detector' has 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' which gives confidence scores. The 'text_language_by_api_ninjas' has 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas'. The 'translate_v3' has 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3', and 'translate_all_languages' has 'detect_for_translate_all_languages'. 

The text provided is in Hindi. The expected output should be 'hi' for Hindi. Let me try the 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' first. The parameters require the text. I'll call that function with the given text. If it returns 'hi', then that's the answer. If not, maybe try another function. But since the text is in Hindi, this function should detect it. Let's proceed.
