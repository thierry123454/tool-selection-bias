 
Okay, the user is asking for the language of the text 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'. Let me see. This looks like Arabic, but I should confirm using the available tools. The tools I have include several language detection functions. Let me pick the most appropriate one. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function seems suitable because it's designed to detect the language of a text. I'll use that. The parameters require the text, so I'll input 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟' and check the result. Once I get the detected language, I can provide the answer.

Action Input:
{
  "text": "مرحبا كيف حالك؟"
}

Okay, the result from the detection was 'ar' which stands for Arabic. So the language is Arabic. I should confirm that this is correct and then present the answer to the user.
Thought:
The detected language code is 'ar' which corresponds to Arabic. The answer is clear.
