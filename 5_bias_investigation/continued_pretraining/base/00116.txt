 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the text 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?'. Let me see which tools I can use. There are several language detection functions available. 

First, I'll check the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' tool. It takes a text input and returns the detected language. The example uses English, but the function should handle other languages too. 

Alternatively, 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' is another option. It also detects the language and supports multiple texts. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' tool is similar, returning the language code. 

The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' might give a confidence score, but the user just needs the language. The 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another possible option. 

Since the text is in Hindi, I should pick a function that can handle Indian languages. Let me try 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' first. If it doesn't work, I can try another tool.
