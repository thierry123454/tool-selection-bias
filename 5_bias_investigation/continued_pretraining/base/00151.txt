 
Okay, the user wants to detect the language of the text '今日は天気がいいです'. Let me see which tools I have available. There are several language detection functions. The text is in Japanese, so I should check which API can handle that.

First, I can use the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function. That API is designed to detect the language even if it's not known. The example mentions it detects the original request's language. Since the text is Japanese, this should work. Alternatively, the 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' might also work, but I should check if it's reliable for Japanese. 

Wait, the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' is specifically for detecting the language within a request, so that's probably the best choice. Let me call that function with the given text. If it returns Japanese, then that's the answer. If not, maybe try another API. But I should start with the most suitable one.

Action Input:

{
  "text": "今日は天気がいいです"
}

Thought:
The result from the detect_for_translate_all_languages function indicates the detected language is Japanese (ja). This directly answers the user's query about the language of the provided text.

{
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The text '今日は天気がいいです' is written in Japanese (language code: ja)."

The task is complete as the language of the text has been successfully detected.
