 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the phrase 'Saluton, kiel vi fartas?'. Let me see which tools I have available. There are several language detection functions. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should choose the most appropriate one.

First, the phrase looks like it might be in a Romance language. 'Saluton' is similar to 'Salut' in French, but 'kiel' is 'how' in English, so maybe it's Esperanto? Wait, 'fartas' could be from 'fari' (to do) in some languages. Let me check the available functions.

Looking at the APIs, there's 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' which detects the language of a text. Another one is 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' which returns the language code. Also, 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' gives a confidence score. But since the user wants to detect the language, maybe the best is to use 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' as it's designed for this purpose. Alternatively, 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another option. 

I should try one of them. Let's start with 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' because it's specifically for detecting the language. The parameters require the text. The input is 'Saluton, kiel vi fartas?'. So I'll call that function with the text. If it returns a result, I can confirm the language. If not, I might need to try another tool.

The function 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' returned the detected language as 'Esperanto'. The result confirms the text is in Esperanto. Now, I should finalize the answer using the 'Finish' function.
