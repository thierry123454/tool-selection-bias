 

Okay, I need to detect the language of the sentence "Hello, how are you today?". Let me see which tools are available. There are several language detection functions. The user might want the most accurate one. Let me check each option.

First, the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function can detect the language. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' also does that. The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' might give a confidence score. The 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another option. The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is also there. 

The sentence is in English. Let me pick the best function. The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is described as returning the language of the text. That seems straightforward. I'll use that. The parameters require the text, so I'll input the sentence. Then, I'll get the detected language and present it as the answer.
