 
Okay, the user is asking for the language of the text '今日はとてもいい天気です'. Let me see. The first step is to determine the language. There are several functions available for language detection. Let me check each one.

The text provided is in Japanese. But I need to confirm using the tools. The functions available include detect_for_translate_all_languages, languagedetection_for_what_s_language, detect_language_for_quick_language_detector, v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas, and fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3. 

I should choose the most reliable one. Let's start with detect_for_translate_all_languages since it's part of the translate_all_languages tool, which mentions detecting the language if unknown. The parameters require the text. So I'll call that function with the given text. 

Wait, the text is '今日はとてもいい天気です'. Let me input that. The function should return the detected language. If it's Japanese, then the answer is Japanese. If not, maybe another function is needed. But I think it's Japanese. Let's proceed.
