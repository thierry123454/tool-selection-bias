Okay, let's see. The user asked to identify the language of the sentence 'Hej, hur mår du?'. I first thought it might be Swedish since 'Hej' is a common greeting there. I used the 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' function, which returned Swedish (sv) with 100% confidence. That confirms it's definitely Swedish. So the final answer should state that clearly.
