 

Okay, I need to detect the language of the text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.' Let me see which tools are available. There are several functions for language detection. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should choose the most appropriate one.

First, the text is in Korean. The functions available include detect_language_for_quick_language_detector, v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas, fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3, detect_for_translate_all_languages, and languagedetection_for_what_s_language. 

I should check which of these functions can accurately detect Korean. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function mentions detecting the language if unknown, so that's a good candidate. Alternatively, 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' is designed for this purpose. Let me try 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' first since it's specifically for detecting language in the translate_all_languages tool. 

Wait, the parameters for detect_for_translate_all_languages require a 'text' input. The example value shows it can handle the text. So I'll call that function with the given text. If it fails, I can try another function. Let's proceed with that.

Action
Action Input:

{
  "text": "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다."
} 

Thought:
The function returned a result indicating the detected language. The response shows the language code 'ko' for Korean. Now, I need to confirm if this is accurate. Since the text is clearly in Korean, the detection is correct. I should present the final answer using the Finish function.
Action
Action Input:

{
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The detected language for the text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.' is Korean (language code: ko)."
} 

Thought:
The task is completed. The language has been successfully detected as Korean. No further actions are needed.
Action
Action Input:

{
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.' is in Korean. The detected language code is 'ko'."
} 

Thought:
The task is complete. The final answer has been provided, confirming the language detection result.
Action
Action Input:

{
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.' is in Korean. The detected language code is 'ko'."
