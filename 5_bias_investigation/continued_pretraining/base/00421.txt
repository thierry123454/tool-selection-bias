 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the text '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?'. Let me see which tools I have available. There are several language detection functions. The user provided a list of subfunctions. Let me check each one.

First, 'what_s_language' has a subfunction 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' that detects the language code. Then there's 'quick_language_detector' with 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' which also gives confidence scores. 'text_language_by_api_ninjas' has 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas'. 'translate_v3' has 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3', and 'translate_all_languages' has 'detect_for_translate_all_languages'. 

The text given is in Spanish, but I should confirm. Let me pick one of the functions. Maybe start with 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' since it's straightforward. The parameters require the text. So I'll call that function with the provided text. If it returns a code, like 'es' for Spanish, that's the answer. If not, I might need to try another function. But since the user wants the language identified, and the text is in Spanish, I expect the result to be Spanish. Let me proceed.
Thought:
I need to determine the language of the text '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?'. The best approach is to use the 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' function, which is designed to detect the language code of a given text.

Action
languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input:
{"text": "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?"}def detect_language(text):
    """
    Detect the language of the given text using the 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' function.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The text to analyze.
        
    Returns:

    response = call_function("languagedetection_for_what_s_language", {"text": text})
    return response["language_code"]

# Example usage:
