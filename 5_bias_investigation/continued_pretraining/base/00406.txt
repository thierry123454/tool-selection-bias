 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the text '안녕하세요, 만나서 반갑습니다.' Let me see which tools are available. There are several functions: what_s_language, quick_language_detector, text_language_by_api_ninjas, translate_v3, and translate_all_languages. Each has subfunctions. 

First, I should check the text. The input is in Korean, but I need to confirm. The functions like what_s_language's languagedetection_for_what_s_language can detect the language. Similarly, translate_all_languages' detect_for_translate_all_languages might work. Let me try one of them. Let's start with the translate_all_languages subfunction, as it's designed for detecting language when the text is unknown. 

So, I'll call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the text '안녕하세요, 만나서 반갑습니다.' The expected result should be Korean. If that works, I can return the answer. If not, maybe try another function like text_language_by_api_ninjas or quick_language_detector. But since the user's text is in Korean, the correct detection should be straightforward.

I need to detect the language of the text '안녕하세요, 만나서 반갑습니다.' The available functions include detect_for_translate_all_languages, which is designed to detect the language of a text. I will use this function first.
