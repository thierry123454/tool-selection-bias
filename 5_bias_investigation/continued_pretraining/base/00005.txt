 
Okay, the user is asking what language the text 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?' is written in. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to determine the language of the given text. The text provided is in Devanagari script, which is used for several Indian languages. The most common language using Devanagari is Hindi, but there are others like Marathi, Gujarati, etc. Since the text is 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?', which translates to 'Hello, how are you today?' in English, I can recognize that this is Hindi. However, to be thorough, I should use one of the available language detection tools to confirm.

Looking at the available functions, there are several options for language detection: detect_for_translate_all_languages, languagedetection_for_what_s_language, detect_language_for_quick_language_detector, v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas, and fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3. Each of these functions might have different accuracy or parameters. 

The user's text is a single sentence, so I should pick a function that can handle individual texts. The detect_for_translate_all_languages function seems appropriate because it can detect the language even if it's not specified. Another option is the v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas, which is specifically for detecting the language. However, the fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3 might also work. 

I need to choose one of these functions. Let me go with detect_for_translate_all_languages because it's designed for detecting the language of a text, and it's part of the translate_all_languages tool. The parameters require the text input, which I have. So I'll call that function with the given text to get the detected language.
Thought:
I need to determine the language of the text 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?'. Since this text is in Devanagari script, it's likely Hindi, but I should confirm using the detect_for_translate_all_languages function for accuracy.

Action

The result from the function will indicate the
