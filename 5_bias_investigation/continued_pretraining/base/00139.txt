 

Okay, the user is asking for the language of the text '今日はとてもいい天気です'. Let me see which tools I can use. There are several language detection functions available. Let me pick one. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' seems suitable because it's designed for detecting the language of a text. I'll call that with the given text. Wait, the parameters require 'text' as a string. The example value mentions detecting when the language is unknown, which fits here. Let me make sure the input is correctly formatted. The text provided is in Japanese, so the function should identify it as Japanese. Once I get the result, I can confirm the language and present the answer.

Action
Action Input: {"text": "今日はとてもいい天気です"} 

Then, after getting the result, I would check if the detected language is correct. If it's Japanese, I can finalize the answer. If not, maybe try another tool. But since the user's text is clearly Japanese, the first tool should work. Then call Finish with the detected language.

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '今日はとてもいい天気です' is Japanese."}

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '今日はとてもいい天気です' is Japanese."} 

But I need to make sure that the function call was successful. If the result from the function call is Japanese, then the answer is correct. Otherwise, maybe try another function. However, given the text is in Japanese, the first function should detect it. So I'll proceed to finish with the answer.
Thought:
Action
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '今日はとてもいい天気です' is Japanese."} 

Wait, but the function call needs to be made first. Let me structure it properly. First, call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the text. Then, based on the result, provide the answer. But in the initial step, I called the function, then the next
