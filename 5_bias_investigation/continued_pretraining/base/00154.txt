 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the text 'Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui'. Let me see which tools are available. There are several functions for language detection. The user provided a list of possible tools. Let me check each one.

First, the 'what_s_language' tool has a subfunction 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' that detects the language code. The 'quick_language_detector' has 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' which also returns confidence scores. The 'text_language_by_api_ninjas' has 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas'. The 'translate_v3' has 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3', and 'translate_all_languages' has 'detect_for_translate_all_languages'. 

The text given is in French: 'Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui' which means 'I am very happy today'. I know that French is a Romance language, so the detected language should be 'fr' for French. 

Let me pick one of the functions. Let's start with 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' since it's straightforward. The parameters require the text. I'll call that function with the provided text. If it returns 'fr', then that's the answer. If not, I might need to try another function. But since I'm confident it's French, maybe the first call will work. Alternatively, using 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' might also work. But let's start with the first one.

Action Input:

{
  "text": "Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui"
} 

Thought:
The function 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' returned the detected language code as 'fr', which corresponds to French. This matches my expectation since the text is in French. Now, I should confirm if this is the correct result and then finalize the answer.

Action
Action Input:

{
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The detected language for the text 'Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui' is French (language code: fr)."
} 

Thought:
The task is complete. The language has been successfully detected as French. I will now provide the final answer.
