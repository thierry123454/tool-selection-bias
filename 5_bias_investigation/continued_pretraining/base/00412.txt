 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the text 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'. Let me see which tools are available. There are several language detection functions. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should choose the most appropriate one.

First, the text is in Arabic. The functions available include detect_for_translate_all_languages, languagedetection_for_what_s_language, detect_language_for_quick_language_detector, v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas, and fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3. 

I should pick one that's reliable. The translate_all_languages tool's detect function might be good. Alternatively, the what_s_language tool. Let me check their descriptions. The detect_for_translate_all_languages function detects the language, and the what_s_language tool also does that. The quick_language_detector might give confidence scores. 

Since the user's text is in Arabic, I can try using detect_for_translate_all_languages first. The parameters require the text. So I'll call that function with the given text. If it returns Arabic, then that's the answer. If not, maybe try another tool. But I should start with the first one.
Thought:
I need to detect the language of the given text. The best approach is to use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function, as it's designed for this purpose.
