 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the text 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?'. Let me see which tools I have available. There are several language detection functions. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should choose the most appropriate one.

First, the text is in Hindi, but I should confirm. The tools include what_s_language, quick_language_detector, text_language_by_api_ninjas, translate_v3, and translate_all_languages. Each has a subfunction. Let me check their descriptions. 

The 'what_s_language' subfunction detects the language code. The 'quick_language_detector' gives confidence scores. 'text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another detector. 'translate_v3' has a detection endpoint. 'translate_all_languages' also detects language. 

Since the user's text is in Hindi, I should use a tool that can detect Indian languages. Let me try 'what_s_language' first. The parameters require the text. So I'll call languagedetection_for_what_s_language with the text 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?'. 

Wait, but maybe the API expects the text in a certain format. Let me make sure. The example for 'what_s_language' is 'How to Identify the Language of any Text', so the input is a string. I'll input the Hindi text. The response should return the language code, which for Hindi is 'hi' or 'hi_IN'. 

Alternatively, maybe 'translate_all_languages' is better since it mentions detecting the language if unknown. But the user's text is clearly Hindi. Let me proceed with the first tool. 

I'll call the languagedetection_for_what_s_language function with the given text. If it returns 'hi', then that's the answer. If not, I might need to try another tool. But I'll start with this one.

The function call was made to detect the language of the provided Hindi text. The response should indicate the detected language code. If the result is 'hi' or 'hi_IN', then the answer is confirmed. If there's an error or the result is unclear, another tool may
