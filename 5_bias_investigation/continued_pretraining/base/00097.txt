 

Okay, the user is asking what language the text 'مرحبا كيف حالك' is written in. Let me see. First, I need to determine the language of this Arabic text. The available tools include several language detection functions. Let me check each one's description.

The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' tool is part of the translate_v3 service. Its example uses English text, but since the user's input is in Arabic, maybe it can handle that. Then there's 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' which is for translate_all_languages. The description says it detects the language if unknown. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' tool specifically detects the language code. The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' might also work, but it requires a text and optionally a detectedcount. The 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another option.

Since the text is in Arabic, I should use a tool that can detect Arabic. Let me try 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' first. The parameters require the text, so I'll input 'مرحبا كيف حالك' there. Alternatively, 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' might also work. Wait, the user's input is in Arabic, so the correct language code is 'ar'. Let me check which tool is most accurate. The 'what_s_language' tool's subfunction is for detecting the language code, so that's a good candidate. Let me call that with the given text.
