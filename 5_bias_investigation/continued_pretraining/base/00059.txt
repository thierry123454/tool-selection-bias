 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the phrase 'Je suis très heureux'. Let me see which tools I have available for language detection. There are several functions: detect_for_translate_all_languages, languagedetection_for_what_s_language, detect_language_for_quick_language_detector, v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas, and fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3. 

First, I should check if any of these functions can handle the given text. The phrase is in French, so I expect the detected language to be French. Let me pick one of the functions to test. Maybe start with detect_for_translate_all_languages since it's part of the translate_all_languages tool, which mentions detecting the language if unknown. The parameters require the text, so I'll input 'Je suis très heureux' there. 

Wait, but the user is asking specifically for the language, so any of these functions should work. Let me proceed with the first one available. The function detect_for_translate_all_languages takes the text as input. Let me call that.
Thought:
