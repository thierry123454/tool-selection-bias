 
Thought: I need to determine the language of the input text '今日はいい天気ですね'. Since this text contains Japanese characters, I'll use the appropriate language detection function.

Action
languagedetection_for_what_s_language

Action Input:
{"text": "今日はいい天気ですね"}

Thought: The function detected the language as Japanese. Now I can confirm that the input text is in Japanese.

Finish

Action Input:
{"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the input text '今日はいい天気ですね' is Japanese."} Alright, let's see. The user asked to find the language of the input '今日はいい天気ですね'. 

First, I need to figure out which function to use. The available tools include several language detection APIs. The text provided is '今日はいい天気ですね', which looks like Japanese. But to be sure, I should use one of the detection functions.

Looking at the subfunctions, there's 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' which detects the language and returns the code. That seems suitable. I'll call that with the given text. The response should confirm the language. Once detected, I can then present the result to the user. Since the text is in Japanese, the answer should state that. Finally, I'll use the Finish function to provide the answer.
