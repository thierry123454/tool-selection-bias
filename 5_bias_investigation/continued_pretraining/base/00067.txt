 

Okay, I need to determine the language of the phrase '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?'. Let me think about the tools available. There are several language detection functions. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should pick the most appropriate one.

First, the phrase is in Spanish. The question marks at the end suggest it's a question. But to confirm, I should use one of the detection tools. Let me check the available subfunctions. The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' might work, but the example uses French. The 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is straightforward. The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' also seems suitable. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' and 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' are options too. 

Since the phrase is in Spanish, I can test one of these. Let me choose 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' because it's simple and direct. The parameters require the text, so I'll input the phrase. Then, the API should return the detected language. If it's Spanish, I can confirm. If not, maybe try another tool. But given the context, Spanish is likely. Once detected, I'll use the 'Finish' function to provide the answer.
Thought:
