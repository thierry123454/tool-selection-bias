 

Okay, I need to detect the language of the sentence "Hello, how are you today?". Let me see which tools I have available. There are several language detection functions. The user might want the most accurate one. Let me check each option.

First, the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is a subfunction for translate_v3. It takes a text input. The example uses a longer text, but the user's sentence is short. Maybe it's okay. Then there's 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' which is for translate_all_languages. The description says it detects language if unknown. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' returns the language code. The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' gives confidence scores. The 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another option.

Since the user's sentence is in English, I expect the result to be English. But I need to choose the best function. The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' might give confidence, but the others are straightforward. Let me pick 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' first. The parameters require 'text', so I'll input the sentence. Let's call that function.
Thought:
I need to detect the language of the given sentence. The function 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is suitable for this task.
