 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the text 'Het is een mooie dag vandaag.' Let me see which tools are available. There are several language detection functions. The user might want the most accurate one. Let me check each option.

The first option is detect_for_translate_all_languages. It says it can detect the language and supports 100+ languages. The example mentions detecting the language if unknown. That sounds reliable. Another option is languagedetection_for_what_s_language, which returns the language code. Quick_language_detector has a confidence score, which might be useful. Text_language_by_api_ninjas is another option, and translate_v3's fast_language_detection. 

Since the user's text is in Dutch, I should pick a function that can handle Dutch. Let me try detect_for_translate_all_languages first because it's described as comprehensive. The parameters require the text, so I'll input the given text there. If it fails, I can try another function. Let's proceed with that.

Action Input:

{
  "text": "Het is een mooie dag vandaag."
} 

Thought:
The function detected the language as Dutch. Now I need to confirm if this is correct. The text 'Het is een mooie dag vandaag' translates to 'It is a nice day today' in English, which is Dutch. So the detection is accurate. I should now provide the final answer using the Finish function.

Action Input:

{
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The text 'Het is een mooie dag vandaag.' is written in Dutch."
} 

Thought:
I have successfully detected the language using the detect_for_translate_all_languages function. The result is accurate, so I will finalize the answer.
