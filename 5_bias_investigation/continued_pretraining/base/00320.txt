 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the phrase 'Мне нравится читать книги.' Let me see which tools I have available. There are several language detection functions. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should pick the most appropriate one.

First, the phrase given is in Cyrillic characters. The phrase translates to "I like reading books." in English. Since the text is in Cyrillic, it's likely Russian. But I need to confirm using one of the tools. 

Looking at the available functions: detect_for_translate_all_languages, languagedetection_for_what_s_language, detect_language_for_quick_language_detector, v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas, and fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3. 

I should choose a function that can detect Cyrillic languages. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function is designed to detect the language when the text is unknown, which fits here. The 'what_s_language' function also detects language codes, but maybe the first one is better for Cyrillic. Alternatively, the 'text_language_by_api_ninjas' might work too. 

Wait, the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function's description says it detects the language of the text, and the example mentions detecting the language when unknown. Since the input is in Cyrillic, which is Russian, but I need to verify. Let me use that function first. The parameters require the text, so I'll input the phrase. 

Alternatively, the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' might also work. But to be safe, I'll use the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function with the given text. Let's proceed with that.
Thought:
I need to determine the language of the given text. The phrase 'Мне нравится читать книги.' is in Cyrillic, which is likely Russian. I'll use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to confirm.

Okay, the user wants to translate a 5-page Russian document into English. Let me think about the tools I have. There's the translate_all_languages function, which can handle translation between languages. But first, I need to make sure the text is in Russian. Wait, the user already mentioned it's Russian
