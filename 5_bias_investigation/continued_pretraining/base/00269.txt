 

Okay, let's see. The user wants to detect the language of the string 'Este es un texto de ejemplo.' 

First, I need to figure out which function to use. There are several language detection tools available. The options include detect_for_translate_all_languages, languagedetection_for_what_s_language, detect_language_for_quick_language_detector, v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas, and fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3.

The string provided is in Spanish. I should check which of these functions can accurately detect Spanish. 

The detect_for_translate_all_languages function is part of the translate_all_languages tool, which claims to detect the language if unknown. The what_s_language function returns the language code. The quick_language_detector might give a confidence score. The text_language_by_api_ninjas is another option. The translate_v3's fast_language_detection might also work.

Since the user's text is in Spanish, I should test one of these functions. Let's start with detect_for_translate_all_languages, as it's part of the translate_all_languages tool, which is designed for translation but also includes detection. Alternatively, the what_s_language function is straightforward for detecting the language code.

Wait, the user just wants the language detected, not translated. So maybe using the what_s_language function, which is specifically for detecting the language and returning the code. Let me check the parameters. The what_s_language function's subfunction is languagedetection_for_what_s_language, which takes the text as input. 

Alternatively, the fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3 is part of the translate_v3 tool. Let me see which one is more reliable. Since the text is in Spanish, the expected language code is 'es'. 

I'll proceed with the what_s_language function's subfunction to detect the language. Let me call languagedetection_for_what_s_language with the text 'Este es un texto de ejemplo.' 

After getting the result, if it returns 'es', then that's the answer. If not, I might need to try another function. But given the text is clearly Spanish, this should work.
Thought:
I need to detect the language of the given text 'Este es un texto de ejemplo.' The most suitable function for this task is 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' which detects the language and returns the language code.

Action
languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input:
{
  "text": "Este es un texto de ejemplo."
