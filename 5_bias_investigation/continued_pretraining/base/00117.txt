 

Okay, I need to detect the language of the phrase '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?'. Let me see which tools are available. There are several language detection functions. The user provided a list of subfunctions. Let me check each one.

First, the 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' function takes text and detectedcount. The example value is in French, but the input here is Korean. Maybe that's okay. Then there's 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' which is straightforward. 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' also seems suitable. 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' is another option. 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' is also there. 

Since the input is Korean, I should pick a function that can handle Korean. Let me try 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' because the description mentions detecting the language if unknown. Alternatively, 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' might be better. Wait, the example for 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' says it detects the language if unknown, which fits here. Let me use that. The parameters require 'text', so I'll input the Korean phrase. Then check the result. If it returns Korean, that's the answer. If not, maybe try another function.

I need to detect the language of the Korean phrase '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?'. I'll use the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function, which is designed to detect the language of the input text.

Action Input:
{
  "text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?"
}

Thought:
The function 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' returned the detected language as Korean (ko). This confirms the phrase is in Korean.

  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The detected language for the phrase '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?' is Korean (ko)."
