Okay, let's see. The user wants to detect the language of the sentence "This is a sample English sentence." I need to use one of the available tools for this. 

First, I should check which functions are suitable. The available functions include various language detection tools like translate_v3's fast_language_detection, what_s_language's languagedetection, quick_language_detector's detect_language, and text_language_by_api_ninjas. 

The user's sentence is in English, so I expect the function to return 'en' as the language code. Let me pick the first function, fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3, since it's straightforward. 

I'll call that function with the text parameter set to the user's sentence. The response should give the language code. Once I get that, I can confirm the result and present it to the user. If there's an error, I might need to try another function, but since the sentence is clearly English, this should work.
Thought: I need to detect the language of the given sentence. I'll use the fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3 function for this task.
Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "This is a sample English sentence."}

Thought: The function returned the detected language as 'en' (English). The task is complete.
Action: Finish
