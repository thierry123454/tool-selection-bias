 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.' Let me see which tools are available. There are several functions for language detection. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should choose the most appropriate one.

First, the text is in Korean. The functions available include text_language_by_api_ninjas, translate_v3, translate_all_languages, what_s_language, and quick_language_detector. Each has a subfunction. Let me check their descriptions. 

The 'text_language_by_api_ninjas' function seems straightforward for detecting language. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' also does language detection. The 'what_s_language' function returns the language code. The 'quick_language_detector' gives a confidence score. 

Since the user wants to detect the language, any of these could work. Let me pick the first one, 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas', as it's the first subfunction. The parameters require the text. I'll call that function with the given text. 

Wait, the text is in Korean. Let me make sure the function can handle that. The example values in the parameters are in English, but the function's description says it detects the language. So I can proceed. 

I'll call the function with the text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.' and see the result. If it returns the language code, then I can confirm it's Korean. If not, maybe try another function. But since the user wants the final answer, I should use the first successful call.
Thought:
I need to detect the language of the given text. The text is '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.' which appears to be in Korean. I'll use the 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' function to check.

Action
v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input:
{
  "text": "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다."
} 

Thought:
The function returned the detected language as 'ko' (Korean). The task is complete.

Action Input:
{
  "return_type": "give_answer",
