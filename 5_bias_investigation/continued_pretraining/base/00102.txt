 
Okay, the user wants to detect the language of the text 'Это тестовое предложение'. Let me see which tools I have available. There are several functions for language detection. The text is in Cyrillic, so it's likely Russian. But I need to use one of the provided APIs to confirm.

First, I'll check the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function. That seems suitable because it's designed for detecting the language of a text. The parameters require the text input. Let me call that function with the given text. 

Wait, the text is 'Это тестовое предложение'. Let me make sure I'm using the correct parameters. The function 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' takes a 'text' parameter. I'll input that text and see the result. If it returns Russian, then that's the answer. If not, maybe try another function. But since the user's query is straightforward, this should work.
