 

Thought:
I need to detect the language of the given text 'Olá, tudo bem?'. There are multiple functions available for language detection. I'll start by using the detect_for_translate_all_languages function as it is designed for this purpose.
Action
detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input:
{"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

Thought:
The function detected the language as 'pt' (Portuguese). However, I should verify this result using another method to ensure accuracy. I'll use the fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3 function for cross-verification.
Action
fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input:
{"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

Thought:
Both functions have confirmed that the text is in Portuguese ('pt'). To further confirm, I can use the v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas function as an additional check.
Action
v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input:
{"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

Thought:
All three functions consistently identified the language as Portuguese ('pt'). This provides strong confirmation that the detected language is accurate. Now, I should present the final answer to the user.
Action
Finish
Action Input:
{"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language for the text 'Olá, tudo bem?' is Portuguese (pt)."}Thought:
