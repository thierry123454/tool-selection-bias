 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the text "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?". Let me see which tools are available. There are several functions for language detection. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should choose the most appropriate one.

First, the text is in French. The function 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' seems suitable because it detects the language of the text. Another option is 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language', which also detects the language code. Alternatively, 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' might work too. 

I should pick one of these. Let me try 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' first. The parameters require the text. The example value shows that it can handle the input. So I'll call that function with the given text. If it returns the correct language, then I can confirm. If not, I might need to try another function. But since the text is clearly French, I expect it to detect 'fr' as the language code.
