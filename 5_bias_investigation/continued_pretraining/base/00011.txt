 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the sentence 'Это пример текста на русском языке'. Let me see which tool to use. The user provided several functions for language detection. 

First, the sentence is in Cyrillic characters. The word 'русском' is a clue, as 'русский' means Russian in English. So I expect the language is Russian. But I should confirm using the tools.

Looking at the available functions: detect_for_translate_all_languages, languagedetection_for_what_s_language, detect_language_for_quick_language_detector, v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas, and fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3. 

I can choose any of these. Let me pick detect_for_translate_all_languages because it's straightforward and detects the language automatically. The parameters require the text. I'll input the given sentence. 

Wait, the example value for detect_for_translate_all_languages says it detects the language if unknown. Since the text is in Russian, the function should return Russian. Let me call that function with the text 'Это пример текста на русском языке'.
