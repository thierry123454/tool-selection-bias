 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the text '今日は良い天気ですね'. Let me see which tool to use. The user provided several translation and detection tools. The best options are the language detection functions. Let me check each available function.

First, the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function can detect the language. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' also does that. The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' might give a confidence score. The 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' and 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' are other options. 

The text given is in Japanese. Let me pick one of the functions. Maybe start with 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' since it's designed for detecting languages. The parameters require the text. So I'll call that function with the provided text.
Thought:
Action
Action Input:
{
  "text": "今日は良い天気ですね"
}

The result from the function will indicate the detected language. Since the text is in Japanese, the response should show Japanese as the detected language. Once confirmed, I can use the 'Finish' function to provide the answer.
Thought:
The function returned the detected language as Japanese. Now, I should finalize the answer using the 'Finish' function.
