 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the sentence "This is a sample English sentence." Let me see which tool to use. The available functions include several language detection APIs. The user provided multiple options, so I should pick the most appropriate one.

First, the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function seems suitable since it's designed for language detection. Alternatively, 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is another option. Both can handle this task. Let me check their parameters. Both require the 'text' parameter. 

The sentence is in English, so the expected result should be 'en' for English. To ensure accuracy, I'll use the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function with the given text. If that returns the correct code, I can confirm the language. If not, I might need to try another tool. But since the sentence is clearly English, this should work.
