 
Thought: I need to detect the language of the given sentence. There are multiple functions available for language detection. I will choose one of them to proceed.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "This is a sample English sentence."}

Thought: The function returned the detected language as 'en' (English). The task is complete.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language for the sentence 'This is a sample English sentence.' is English (code: en)."}
Okay, let's see. The user wants to detect the language of the sentence "This is a sample English sentence." I have several tools available for this. The first step is to pick the right function. The tools include translate_v3, translate_all_languages, what_s_language, quick_language_detector, and text_language_by_api_ninjas. Each has a subfunction.

I should check which function is most reliable. The translate_all_languages has a detect subfunction that can detect the language. The example value mentions detecting even if the language isn't known. The parameters require the text. So I'll use detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given sentence. 

After calling that function, the response comes back as 'en' which is English. That's correct. Now, I need to confirm if this is sufficient. Since the task is just to detect the language, and the function worked, I can finish here. The final answer should state the detected language and its code. So I'll use the Finish function with the result.
