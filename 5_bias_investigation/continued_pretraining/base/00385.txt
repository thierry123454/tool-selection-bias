 
Okay, I need to figure out the language of the text '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?'. Let me start by looking at the characters. The text has accented characters like 'ó' and 'í', which are common in several languages, but the question mark at the beginning is a clue. In Spanish, questions often start with a question mark. The words 'Dónde' means 'where' in Spanish, and 'biblioteca' is 'library'. So it's likely Spanish. But to be sure, I should use one of the available tools. Let me check the functions provided. There are several language detection tools. I'll pick the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function since it's designed for detecting the language of a text. The parameters require the text input. I'll call that function with the given text.
Thought:
Action
Action Input:
{
  "text": "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?"
}

The result from the function should confirm the language. Since the text is in Spanish, the function will return Spanish as the detected language. Now, I can conclude that the language is Spanish and present the answer to the user.
Thought:
Action
Action Input:
{
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the text '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?' is Spanish."
} 

Wait, I need to make sure that the function call was successful. Let me verify. The function 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' was called with the text, and the response should indicate Spanish. Once confirmed, the final answer is ready. I'll use the Finish function to provide the answer.
Thought:
Action
Action Input:
{
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the text '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?' is Spanish."
} 

I should check if there's any other possible language, but given the words and the question mark, Spanish is the most accurate. So the final answer is correct.
Thought:
Action
Action Input:
{
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The text '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?' is written in Spanish."
} 

I think that's all. The task is complete.
