 
Okay, the user is asking to detect the language of the text 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'. Let me see which tools I have available. There are several language detection functions. The text looks like Latin, but I should check.

First, I can use the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function. That's one of the subfunctions. The parameters require the text. Let me call that. The input is 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'. 

Wait, maybe another function would be better. The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is another option. Or maybe 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas'. But since the user's text is in Latin, which is not a modern language, some tools might not recognize it. Let me try the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' first. 

After getting the result, if it doesn't detect, maybe try another function. But I need to make sure. Let me proceed with the first call.
Thought:
Action
Action Input:

{
  "text": "Salve, quid agis hodie?"
} 

Wait, the function 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' is the subfunction for 'translate_all_languages', which is supposed to detect the language. Let me call that. The input is the text provided. 

But maybe the 'what_s_language' function's subfunction 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' is also suitable. However, I should check which one is more accurate. Since the text is in Latin, which is not a supported language in some APIs, the result might be 'undetected' or 'unknown'. Let me proceed with the first available function.
Thought:
Action
Action Input:

{
  "text": "Salve, quid agis hodie?"
} 

The result from the function call might indicate that the language is not recognized. If that's the case, I should try another function. For example, 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' or 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector'. But since the user's query is about detecting the language, and the text is in Latin, which is not a modern language, the answer should state that it's Latin. However, the functions might not support it. Let me check the results. If all functions fail, I'll have to inform the user that the language is Latin, even if the tools don't detect it. But according to the task, if
