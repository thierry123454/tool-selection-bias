 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the text 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?'. Let me see which tools I have available for language detection.

First, the user is asking specifically about the language of a given text. The available functions include several language detection tools. Let me check each one's description to see which is most appropriate.

The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function is part of the translate_all_languages tool. Its description says it detects the language of the text. The parameters require the text input. Since the user's text is in French, this function should work.

Another option is 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language', which also detects the language and returns the code. The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' provides a confidence score, which might be helpful. The 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' and 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' are other options. 

Since the user's text is clearly in French, I can use any of these functions. Let me pick one. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' seems straightforward. I'll call that function with the provided text.
