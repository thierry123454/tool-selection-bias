 
Okay, the user is asking about the language of the text '今日は元気ですか？'. Let me see. The text is in Japanese, but I need to confirm using the available tools. The tools provided include several language detection functions. Let me choose the most appropriate one. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function seems suitable because it's designed for detecting the language of a text. I'll use that. The parameters require the text input, so I'll call the function with the given text. Once I get the result, I can determine the language and provide the answer.

} The text '今日は元気ですか？' is in Japanese. The detection was performed using the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function, which identified the language based on the input text. The result confirms that the language is Japanese. I'll now finalize the answer.
