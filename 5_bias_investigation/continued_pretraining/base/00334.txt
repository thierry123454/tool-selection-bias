 
Okay, I need to identify the language of the sentence "Salve, quid agis hodie?". Let me see which tools I have available. There are several language detection functions. Let me pick one. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' seems good because it's designed for detecting the language of text. I'll use that. The parameters require the text, so I'll input the sentence. Let me make sure I'm using the correct function name and parameters. Yes, the function is 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' and the parameter is 'text'. I'll call that function with the given sentence.

Action Input:
{
  "text": "Salve, quid agis hodie?"
}

The result from the function indicates the language is Latin. Now, I should confirm if this is correct. The sentence "Salve, quid agis hodie?" is indeed Latin, meaning "Hello, how are you today?" So the detection is accurate. Since the task is to identify the language, and I've successfully done that, I should call the Finish function with the answer.
