 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the text '안녕하세요, 만나서 반갑습니다.' Let me see which tools are available. There are several language detection functions. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should choose the most appropriate one.

First, the text is in Korean. The characters are Hangul. But I should confirm using the tools. Let me check the available functions. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function can detect the language. Another option is 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' or 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3'. 

I should pick one. Let me try 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' first. The parameters require the text. So I'll call that function with the given text. If it returns a language code, that's the answer. If not, maybe try another function. But since the text is clearly Korean, the result should be straightforward. Let me proceed.
