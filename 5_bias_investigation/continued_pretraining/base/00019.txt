 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the text 'Merhaba, nasılsın?'. Let me see which tools I can use. The user provided several APIs for language detection. 

First, I'll check the available functions. There's text_language_by_api_ninjas, translate_v3, translate_all_languages, what_s_language, and quick_language_detector. Each has a subfunction. 

The text 'Merhaba, nasılsın?' is in Turkish. Let me test one of the functions. Maybe start with 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' since it's designed for detecting language. The parameters require the text. 

I'll call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text. If it returns Turkish, that's the answer. If not, I might need to try another function. But since the user example mentions Turkish, this should work.

The result from the translation API detected the language as Turkish. Now I need to confirm if this is correct and provide the final answer.
