 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다'. Let me see which tools are available. There are several functions for language detection. The user provided a list of subfunctions. Let me check each one.

First, the 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' function. Its description says it's for detecting language using the API Ninjas Text Language API. The parameters require a 'text' input. The example value is 'hello world!', so I can use this function with the given text.

Another option is 'detect_for_translate_all_languages', which is part of the translate_all_languages tool. Its description mentions detecting the language of text. The parameters also require a 'text' input. The example value includes a sentence about language detection, so that's relevant.

There's also 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language', which detects the language code. The parameters need 'text'. The example value is 'How to Identify the Language of any Text', so that's applicable.

The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' function requires 'text' and an optional 'detectedcount'. The example value includes a French sentence, but the text here is Korean. However, this function might still work.

The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is another option, part of the translate_v3 tool. It returns the language of the text. The example value is a longer sentence, so it might handle the given text.

Since the user's text is in Korean, I should choose a function that can detect Korean. Let me check which of these functions are most likely to handle Korean. The API Ninjas Text Language API (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas) might be reliable. Alternatively, the translate_all_languages detect function (detect_for_translate_all_languages) could work. The what_s_language function might also detect it. 

I'll start by using the v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas function with the text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다'. If that doesn't work, I can try another function. Let's proceed with that first.
Thought:
I need to detect the language of the Korean text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다'. The best approach is to use the API Ninjas Text Language API for accurate detection.
