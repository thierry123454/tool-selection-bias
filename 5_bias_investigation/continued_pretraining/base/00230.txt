 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the text 'Привет, как дела?'. Let me see which tools I can use. There are several language detection functions available. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should pick the most appropriate one.

First, the text is in Russian. The characters are Cyrillic, so it's likely Russian. But I need to confirm using one of the tools. Let me check the available functions. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function seems suitable because it's designed to detect the language of a text. Another option is 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language', which also detects the language code. 

I'll start by using 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' with the given text. The parameters require the text input. Let me call that function with 'Привет, как дела?'. The response should return the detected language. If that's not successful, I can try another tool. But since the text is clearly Russian, I expect this function to identify it as such. Once I get the result, I can confirm the language and provide the answer.

  "text": "Привет, как дела?"

Thought:
The function returned the detected language as Russian (ru). Now I need to present this information to the user clearly.

  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The text 'Привет, как дела?' is in Russian (language code: ru)."
} 

Thought:
The task is complete. The language has been successfully detected and the result is ready to be presented to the user. I will now call the Finish function to conclude the task.
