 

Okay, I need to detect the language of the text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다'. Let me see which tools I have available. There are several functions for language detection. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should choose the most appropriate one.

First, the text is '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다'. I recognize that this is Korean. But to confirm, I should use one of the tools. Let me check the available functions. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function seems suitable because it's designed for detecting the language of a text. Another option is 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language', which also detects the language code. Alternatively, 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another option. 

Wait, the text is in Korean, so I should test which function can correctly identify it. Let me try 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' first. The parameters require the text, so I'll input the Korean text. The function should return the detected language. If it's Korean, then that's the answer. If not, I might need to try another function. Alternatively, using 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' might give the language code. Let me proceed with the first function.

I need to detect the language of the text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다'. I'll use the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function for this task.

Action
detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input:
{"text": "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다"}Premature end of script in /home/runner/autogpt/autogpt/autogpt/tools/translate_all_languages.py.

Thought:
The function call failed. I'll try another language detection tool, such as 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language'.

Action
languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input:
{"text": "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다"}
Action Result:
{"language": "ko", "confidence": 0.9999999999999999}

Thought:
The text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다' is detected as Korean (ko) with high confidence. I can now provide the final answer.
