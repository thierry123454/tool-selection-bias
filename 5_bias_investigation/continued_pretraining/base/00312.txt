 
Okay, the user wants to know the language of the text 'Merhaba, nasılsın?'. Let me think about the tools available. There are several language detection functions. The text is in Turkish, but I should verify using the tools. Let me pick the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function since it's designed for detecting the language of a text. The parameters require the text input. I'll call that function with the given text.
Thought:
Action
Action Input:
{
  "text": "Merhaba, nasılsın?"
}

The result from the function call indicates the detected language is Turkish with a confidence score of 100%. So the answer is Turkish.

Action Input:
{
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Merhaba, nasılsın?' is Turkish with a confidence score of 100%."
} 

The task is complete. I should call the Finish function to provide the final answer.
