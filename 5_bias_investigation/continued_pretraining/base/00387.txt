 
Okay, the user is asking to detect the language of the sentence 'אני לומד עברית'. Let me see which tools I have available for language detection.

First, I can use the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' tool. It takes a text input and returns the detected language. The example value shows it works with Hebrew text, so that's promising. 

Alternatively, there's 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' which also detects language. 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' and 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' are other options. The last one, 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas', is another possible choice. 

Since the user's sentence is in Hebrew, I should check which of these tools can handle Hebrew. The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is part of the translate_v3 tool, which might be reliable. Let me try that first. 

I'll call 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' with the text 'אני לומד עברית'. If it returns Hebrew, that's the answer. If not, I might need to try another tool. But given the example, it's likely to work. 

So the action is to use that specific function with the provided text.
Thought:
I need to detect the language of the Hebrew text 'אני לומד עברית'. The function 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is suitable for this task as it detects the language of a given text. I will use this function with the provided text.

Okay, the user is asking to detect the language of the sentence 'C'est une phrase en français'. Let me check the available tools again. 

The sentence is in French, so I need a tool that can detect French. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function is designed for this. It takes a text input and detects the language. Since the example mentions detecting languages like French, this should work. 

Alternatively, 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' or 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' could also be options. But 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' seems straightforward. 

I'll use 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' with the text 'C'est une phrase en français' to get the detected language.
