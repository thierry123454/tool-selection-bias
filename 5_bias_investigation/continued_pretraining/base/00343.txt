 

Okay, the user is asking what language the sentence 'אני לומד עברית' is in. Let me see. First, I need to detect the language of that text. The sentence is in Hebrew, but I should confirm using one of the available tools.

Looking at the tools, there are several language detection functions. Let me pick the most appropriate one. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function seems suitable because it's designed for detecting the language of a text. The parameters require the text input, which in this case is 'אני לומד עברית'. 

I'll call that function with the given text. The API should return the detected language. Once I get the result, I can check if it correctly identifies Hebrew. If there's an error or it's not detected, I might need to try another tool, but let's start with this one.
