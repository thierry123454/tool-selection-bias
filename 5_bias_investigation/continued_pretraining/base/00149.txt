 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the given text 'Это пример текста на русском языке'. Let me see which tools are available. There are several functions for language detection. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should choose the most appropriate one.

First, the text is in Russian. The task is straightforward. Let me check each function's description. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function seems suitable because it detects the language of the text. Also, 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' and 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' are options. 

I should pick one. Let's go with 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' since it's designed for detecting languages across 100+ supported languages. The parameters require the text, so I'll input the given text. Let me make sure the parameters are correct. The function's example value mentions detecting when the language is unknown, but here the text is clearly Russian. 

Another option is 'what_s_language' or 'text_language_by_api_ninjas', but 'translate_all_languages' seems more comprehensive. Let me proceed with that. The function call should be detect_for_translate_all_languages with the text parameter set to 'Это пример текста на русском языке'. 

Wait, the parameters for 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' have 'text' as a required parameter. The example value is a sentence about the API's capability. So, passing the Russian text should work. The response should return the detected language. Once I get the result, I can confirm the language is Russian and then use the Finish function to provide the answer.
