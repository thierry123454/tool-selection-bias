 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the input text 'Hej, hur mår du idag?'. Let me see which tools I can use. There are several language detection functions available. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should choose the most appropriate one.

First, the input text is in Swedish. The words 'Hej' (hello), 'hur mår du' (how are you) are Swedish. But I need to confirm using one of the tools. Let me check the available functions. 

The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' function can detect up to 52 languages and gives confidence scores. The 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another option. The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' and 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' also detect language. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' returns the language code. 

I should pick one of these. Let me start with 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' because it's designed for detecting the language of text, and the example mentions handling unknown languages. Alternatively, 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is straightforward. 

Wait, the input is 'Hej, hur mår du idag?', which is clearly Swedish. But to use the tool, I need to call one of the functions. Let me try 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' first. The parameters require 'text', so I'll input the text. 

Alternatively, maybe 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' is more direct. Let me check the parameters. All functions require the 'text' parameter. Let me proceed with one of them. 

I'll use 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' with the given text. If it returns Swedish, then that's the answer. If not, I can try another tool. Let's proceed.

Thought:
The result from detect_for_translate_all_languages indicates the detected language. Let me check the response. If it's Swedish, then the answer is Swedish. If there's an error or it's unclear, I may need to try another tool.

The detected language is Swedish. The answer should confirm this. I'll use the Finish function to
