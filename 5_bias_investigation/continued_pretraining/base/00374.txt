 
Thought:
The user wants to detect the language of the text '今日は天気がいいです'. I need to use one of the available language detection functions. Let me check which function is most suitable.

Action
languagedetection_for_what_s_language

Action Input:
{"text": "今日は天気がいいです"}

Thought:
The function 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' was called with the text '今日は天気がいいです'. The result indicates the detected language code is 'ja' (Japanese). This answers the user's query.

Action
Finish

Action Input:
{"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language for the text '今日は天気がいいです' is Japanese (language code 'ja')."}

Thought:
The task is complete. The language of the given text has been successfully detected and the result is provided to the user. No further actions are needed. I will call the Finish function to conclude the task.
Alright, let me break down how I approached this. The user asked to detect the language of the text '今日は天気がいいです'. First, I needed to choose the right tool from the available functions. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' function seemed appropriate because it's designed to detect the language of a given text and return the language code. I called this function with the provided text. The response came back as 'ja', which is the language code for Japanese. Since the task was to detect the language, I then used the Finish function to present the result to the user. The final answer clearly states the detected language and its code, fulfilling the user's request efficiently.
