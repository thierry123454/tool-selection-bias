 

Thought: I need to identify the language of the given sentence 'Das ist ein schöner Tag.' I'll use the appropriate language detection function for this task.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag."}

Thought: The function detected the language as German. Now I can confirm that the sentence is in German.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'Das ist ein schöner Tag.' is German."} Alright, let's see. The user wants to know the language of the sentence 'Das ist ein schöner Tag.' 

First, I need to choose the right tool. There are several language detection functions available. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should pick the most suitable one. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' seems appropriate here since it's designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code.

I'll call that function with the input text. The response should give the language code. Once I get the code, I can convert it to the language name if needed. Since the example uses German text, I expect the result to be 'de' for German. 

After confirming the detection, I'll use the 'Finish' function to provide the final answer. The user probably wants the language name, so I'll make sure to state it clearly. If there's any uncertainty, I might need to use another tool for verification, but given the context, this should suffice.
