 

Okay, the user wants to know the language of the text '今日はお元気ですか？'. Let me think about the tools available.

First, I need to check which functions can detect the language. There are several options: detect_for_translate_all_languages, languagedetection_for_what_s_language, detect_language_for_quick_language_detector, v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas, and fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3.

The text provided is '今日はお元気ですか？', which looks like Japanese. But I should use a tool to confirm. Let me pick one of the functions. Maybe start with detect_for_translate_all_languages since it's part of the translate_all_languages tool, which is designed for detecting languages. The parameters require the text, so I'll input the given text. 

Wait, but the user might have other tools that are more accurate. Alternatively, the quick_language_detector's detect_language_for_quick_language_detector also detects with confidence scores. But since the text is short, maybe the detection is straightforward. Let me try the first function. 

So, I'll call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the text '今日はお元気ですか？'. The response should indicate the detected language. If it's Japanese, then that's the answer. If not, maybe try another tool. But I should proceed step by step.
Thought:
