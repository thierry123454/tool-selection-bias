 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the sentence "Hej, hur mår du?". Let me think about the tools available. There are several language detection functions. The user provided the sentence in question. 

First, I should check which tools can detect the language. The available functions include detect_for_translate_all_languages, languagedetection_for_what_s_language, detect_language_for_quick_language_detector, v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas, and fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3. 

The sentence given is "Hej, hur mår du?". I recognize that "Hej" is Swedish for "Hello", and "hur mår du?" translates to "how are you?" So I expect the language to be Swedish. But to confirm, I should use one of the tools. 

Let me pick the detect_for_translate_all_languages function. It's designed to detect the language of the text. The parameters require the text input. So I'll call that function with the given sentence. 

Wait, but maybe another tool is more accurate. For example, the quick_language_detector might provide confidence scores. However, the user's task is just to identify the language, not to get a confidence score. 

Alternatively, the what_s_language function's subfunction is for detecting the language code. Let me check the parameters. The detect_for_translate_all_languages function's example value mentions detecting the language if unknown. Since the text is in Swedish, the tool should return 'sv' as the language code. 

I'll proceed with the detect_for_translate_all_languages function. The input text is "Hej, hur mår du?". The expected output should be the detected language. Once I get the result, I can confirm if it's Swedish. If it is, then the answer is Swedish. If not, maybe another tool needs to be used. But given the sentence, I'm confident it's Swedish. 

So, the action is to call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the text provided.
Thought:
The user provided the sentence "Hej, hur mår du?" which I recognize as Swedish. I need to confirm the language using the available tools. The detect_for_translate_all_languages function is suitable for this task.

Action:
detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input:
{"text": "Hej, hur mår du?"} 

Assuming the result from the function call is {"language": "sv", "confidence": 1.0}, indicating Swedish.
