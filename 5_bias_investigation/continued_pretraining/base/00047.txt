 
Okay, the user is asking about the language of the phrase "Je suis très heureux." Let me see which tools I can use. There are several language detection functions available. I need to pick the most appropriate one. The phrase is in French, so I should check if any of the tools can detect that. Let me try the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function first since it's designed for detecting languages across many supported ones. I'll input the text and see the result.

Action Input:
{
  "text": "Je suis très heureux"
}

The result from the function should indicate the detected language. If it's French, then the answer is French. If not, I might need to try another tool. Let's assume the function returns French here. Then I can confirm the answer. If there's an error, I'll have to try another method, like 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' or 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas'. But given the initial input, French is likely. Once confirmed, I'll use the Finish function to provide the answer.
