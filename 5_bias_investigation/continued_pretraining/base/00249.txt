 
Okay, I need to figure out the language of the text 'Este es un texto de ejemplo'. Let me see which tools I have available for language detection. There are several functions: detect_for_translate_all_languages, languagedetection_for_what_s_language, detect_language_for_quick_language_detector, v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas, and fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3. 

First, I'll try using detect_for_translate_all_languages because it's part of the translate_all_languages tool, which is designed for detecting the language of a text. The parameters require the text input, which in this case is 'Este es un texto de ejemplo'. I'll call that function with the given text.

Wait, the user's query is straightforward. The text provided is in Spanish, but I should confirm using the tool. Let me make sure the function is correctly called. The parameters are set up to take the text, so I'll input that. If the result comes back as Spanish, then that's the answer. If not, I might need to try another function. But since the user asked specifically for identification, I should proceed with the first available function.
Thought:
