Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants to know the language of the sentence 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'. At first glance, it looks like Latin, but I need to verify using the tools provided.

First, I'll use the 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' function. This tool is designed to detect the language code of a given text. Inputting the sentence should give a code.
