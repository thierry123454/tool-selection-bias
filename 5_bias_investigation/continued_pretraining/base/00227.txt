 
Okay, I need to figure out the language of the sentence 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'. Let me see which tools I have available. There are several language detection functions. The user provided a list of subfunctions. Let me check each one.

First, the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' function. Its description says it returns the language of the text. That sounds right. The parameters require a 'text' input. The example value is a sentence in English, but the function should work for any text. 

Another option is 'detect_for_translate_all_languages', which also detects language. The 'what_s_language' function's subfunction 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' is similar. Then there's 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' which includes a confidence score, and 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' from API Ninjas. 

The user's sentence is in Spanish. Let me test which function can detect it. Since the example values in the functions are in English, but the function should handle other languages. Let me pick the first one, 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3', and call it with the text 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'. That should work. If it fails, I can try another function.
Thought:
I need to determine the language of the given text. The best approach is to use the fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3 function, which is designed for this purpose.

Action
fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input:
{"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"}I need to determine the language of the given text. The best approach is to use the fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3 function, which is designed for this purpose.

Action
fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input:
{"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"}

The function returned the result "es" which is the language code for Spanish. Now I can confirm that the sentence is in Spanish. Since the task is to identify the language, I should use the Finish function to provide the answer.
Thought:
The function call returned the language code "es" for the text, which corresponds to Spanish. The task is complete.

{"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?' is Spanish (language code 'es')."}.}
