 

Okay, I need to figure out the language of the sentence "Hej, hur m√•r du?". Let me start by recalling the available functions. There are several language detection tools here. The user provided a list of subfunctions. Let me check each one's description to see which is most appropriate.

The first function is v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas. Its description says it's for detecting language using the API Ninjas Text Language API. The parameters require a 'text' input. The example value is 'hello world!', which is English. But the sentence here is in Swedish, so I need a tool that can handle that.

Next, fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3. This is part of the translate_v3 tool. The description mentions returning the language of the text. The example uses a longer English text, but the function should work for any language. 

Then there's detect_for_translate_all_languages, which is part of the translate_all_languages tool. The description says it detects the language of the text. The example mentions detecting when the language is unknown, which fits here. 

The what_s_language tool's detect_languagedetection function is for detecting the language code. The example given is in French, but the function should work for other languages too. 

The quick_language_detector's detect_language function can determine the language with a confidence score. The example is in French, but again, it should handle other languages. 

So, which function is best? The user's sentence is in Swedish. Let me check if any of these functions are known to handle Swedish. The translate_all_languages tool's detect function might be reliable. Alternatively, the what_s_language function. 

Wait, the translate_all_languages tool's detect function is described as detecting the language of the text. The example value mentions that if the language is unknown, it detects the original request. So that's a good fit. 

Alternatively, the what_s_language function's detect function. Let me check the parameters. The detect_languagedetection function for what_s_language requires the text. 

Alternatively, the quick_language_detector's detect_language function, which can provide confidence scores. 

But the user's task is just to identify the language, not to get confidence scores. So maybe the translate_all_languages detect function is sufficient. 

Alternatively, the fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3. Let me see. The example for that function uses a longer English text, but the function should work for any language.
