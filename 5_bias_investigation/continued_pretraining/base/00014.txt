 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the text 'שלום, מה שלומך היום?'. Let me see which tools are available. There are several functions for language detection. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should choose the most appropriate one.

First, the text is in Hebrew. But I need to confirm using the tools. Let me check each function's description. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function seems suitable because it detects the language of the text. Also, 'what_s_language' and 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' might work. Alternatively, 'text_language_by_api_ninjas' could be used. 

Wait, the text is 'שלום, מה שלומך היום?', which is Hebrew. Let me pick the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function. The parameters require the text. So I'll call that function with the given text. Let me make sure the parameters are correct. The function's example value mentions detecting languages when the text is unknown, so this should work. 

I'll use the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function with the text provided. Then, the result should indicate the detected language. Once I get the result, I can confirm the language and present the answer.
