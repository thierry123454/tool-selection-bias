 
Okay, I need to figure out the language of the phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'. Let me start by recalling that this phrase is in German. But to follow the process, I should use the available tools. The user provided several language detection functions. Let me check each one's description.

First, the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function can detect the language. The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' also does language detection. The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' might give confidence scores. The 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' and 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' are other options. 

Since the phrase is 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?', which is clearly German, but to simulate the process, I should call one of the functions. Let me pick 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' first. The parameters require the text. So I'll input the text and see the result. If it returns German, then that's the answer. If not, maybe try another function. But given the example in the tool's description, it mentions detecting the language when the text is unknown. Since the example uses English, but the function should handle any text. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is more accurate. But I'll start with the first one. Let me call 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' with the text 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'.
