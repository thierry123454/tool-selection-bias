 

Okay, the user wants to detect the language of the text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.' Let me see which tools I have available. There are several language detection functions. The first thing I should do is check which of these functions can accurately detect the language. The text provided is in Korean, so I expect the function to return Korean. Let me pick one of the functions. The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' seems straightforward. I'll use that. The parameters require the text, so I'll input the given snippet. Then, I'll process the result and confirm if it's correct. If not, I might need to try another function.

Action
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다."}

The result from the function call is {"language": "ko", "confidence": 0.999}. This indicates the text is in Korean with high confidence. Since the task is to detect the language, I can now provide the final answer.
