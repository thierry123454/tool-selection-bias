 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the given text 'Das Wetter ist heute schön.' Let me see which tools are available. There are several functions for language detection. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should choose the most appropriate one.

First, the text is in German. I should check which API can accurately detect German. Let me review the functions. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function seems suitable because it's designed for language detection across many languages. Also, the 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' and 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' are options. However, the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' might be the best choice since it's explicitly for detecting the language of text. 

I'll use the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function with the provided text. The parameters require the text input. Let me make sure to format the action correctly. The function call should include the text parameter. Once I get the result, I can confirm the detected language and provide the answer.
