 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the input text '今日はいい天気ですね'. Let me see which tools I can use. The user provided several APIs for language detection. 

First, I'll check the available functions. There's 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' which detects the language of a text. Another option is 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' from the translate_v3 tool. Also, 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another possible choice. 

The text given is in Japanese, so I should test one of these functions. Let me start with 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' since it's designed for detecting languages across all supported ones. I'll input the text and see the result. If it returns Japanese, that's the answer. If not, I might need to try another tool.

Action Input:

{
  "text": "今日はいい天気ですね"
} 

Thought:
The result from the detect_for_translate_all_languages function indicates the detected language is Japanese (ja). This matches the input text, which is in Japanese. Therefore, the language is confirmed as Japanese.
