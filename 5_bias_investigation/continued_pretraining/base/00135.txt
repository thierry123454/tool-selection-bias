First, I notice that the phrase uses Cyrillic characters, which are common in several languages like Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, etc. But I need to confirm the exact language. 

I should use one of the language detection tools available. The user provided several options, so I'll pick the most suitable one. The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' function seems appropriate because it's designed to detect the language with a confidence score. 

I'll input the text into that tool. The response should give the detected language. If it's Russian, which is the most likely candidate here, then the answer is confirmed. If not, I might need to try another tool, but given the characters used, Russian is the top possibility.

After getting the result, I'll finalize the answer using the Finish function.
