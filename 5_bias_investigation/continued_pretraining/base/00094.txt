Action
detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;"}

Thought: The API detected the language as Greek. Now I can confirm that the text is in Greek.

Action
Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;' is in Greek."} Alright, let's see. The user asked to identify the language of the text 'Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;'. I used the detect_for_translate_all_languages function, which correctly identified it as Greek. Then I called Finish with the answer. That should be it. The final answer is clear and confirms the language. No need for further steps.
Thought: The task is complete. The language of the text has been successfully identified as Greek.
