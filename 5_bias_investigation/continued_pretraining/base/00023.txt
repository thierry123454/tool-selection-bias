 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the input text 'Ciao, come stai oggi?'. Let me think about the tools available. There are several language detection functions. Let me check their descriptions. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function can detect the language, as can 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language', 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector', 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas', and 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3'. 

The input text is 'Ciao, come stai oggi?'. This looks like Italian. Let me confirm. 'Ciao' means hello, 'come stai' is how are you, and 'oggi' is today. So it's Italian. But to be thorough, I should use one of the functions. Which one is the best? The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function is designed to detect the language, and since the user mentioned that if the language is unknown, it can detect it. Also, the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is another option. Let me pick one. Maybe 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' since it's part of the translate_all_languages tool, which is described as detecting the language if unknown. Let me call that function with the text 'Ciao, come stai oggi?'.
Thought:
I need to determine the language of the input text 'Ciao, come stai oggi?'. The text appears to be in Italian, but I should confirm using the available functions. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function is suitable for this task as it detects the language of the text.

Assistant: 
Okay, I need to figure out the language of the text 'Ciao, come stai oggi?'. Let me start by looking at the words. 'Ciao' is Italian for 'hello', 'come stai'
