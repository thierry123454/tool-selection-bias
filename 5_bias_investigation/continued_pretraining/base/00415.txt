 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the text 'Olá, tudo bem?'. Let's see which tools are available. There are several language detection functions. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should choose the most appropriate one.

First, the text is 'Olá, tudo bem?'. This looks like Portuguese. But I should confirm using the tools. Let me check the available functions. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function can detect the language. Another option is 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3'. Both seem suitable. Maybe start with 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' since it's designed for detecting the language of a text. 

Wait, the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function is part of the 'translate_all_languages' tool. The description says it detects the language of the text. Let me use that. The parameters require the text. So I'll call that function with the given text. 

Alternatively, the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' is another option. But since the user's text is short, maybe the first function is better. Let me proceed with 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' and input the text. 

If the result comes back as Portuguese, then that's the answer. If not, maybe try another function. But I should start with the first one.
