 
Okay, I need to figure out the language of the text '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?'. Let me start by looking at the characters. The text has question marks and some accented letters like 'ó' and 'í'. That suggests it might be a Romance language, possibly Spanish. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the available functions to detect the language.

First, I can use the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function. It's designed to detect the language of a given text. The parameters require the text input. Let me call that function with the provided text. 

Alternatively, there's the 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' function, which also detects the language code. Another option is 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' or 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas'. But since the user provided multiple tools, I should pick the most reliable one. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' seems appropriate here. Let me execute that first.

The text "Ciao, come stai?" contains Italian words like "Ciao" (hello) and "come stai?" (how are you?), indicating it is likely in Italian. However, I should verify using the available functions to ensure accuracy.
