 
Okay, I need to determine the language of the text 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'. Let me start by recalling the available functions. There are several language detection tools listed. The user provided a list of subfunctions, so I should choose the most appropriate one.

First, the text in question is 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟', which appears to be in Arabic. But I should confirm using the tools. The functions available include detect_for_translate_all_languages, languagedetection_for_what_s_language, detect_language_for_quick_language_detector, v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas, and fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3. 

I should pick one of these functions. Let me consider each. The detect_for_translate_all_languages function is designed to detect the language of a text. The example given mentions detecting the language when the text is unknown. The languagedetection_for_what_s_language function also detects the language and returns the code. The detect_language_for_quick_language_detector might provide confidence scores. The v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas is another option. The fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3 is part of the translate_v3 tool.

Since the user's text is in Arabic, I can check which function is most reliable. However, since I don't have the actual implementation, I'll proceed with one of the functions. Let me use detect_for_translate_all_languages as it's the first one mentioned. The parameters require the text input. So I'll call that function with the given text.
Thought:
I need to determine the language of the text 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'. The best approach is to use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function, which is designed for language detection.

Action
detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input:
{"text": "مرحبا كيف حالك؟"} 

Assuming the result comes back as Arabic, I can then confirm the language. If there's an error, I might need to try another function. But since the text is clearly in Arabic, this should work. Once confirmed, I can use the Finish function to provide the answer. 

Wait, but the system requires that after each action, I must call Finish. However, the user's instruction says to call Finish at the end. So after getting the result, I should then call Finish with the answer. But in the initial step, I should only call one action. Let me correct that. The first action is to detect the language. Then
