 
Okay, I need to detect the language of the text 'Привет, как дела?'. Let me see which tools are available. There are several functions for language detection. The user provided a list of APIs, so I should choose the most appropriate one.

First, the text is in Russian. The characters are Cyrillic, so the language is likely Russian. But I should confirm using the tools. Let me check the available functions. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' function seems suitable because it's designed to detect the language of the text. The 'what_s_language' and 'quick_language_detector' might also work, but the 'translate_all_languages' function's subfunction is specifically for detection. 

I'll use 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' with the given text. The parameters require the text input. Let me call that function with 'Привет, как дела?'. The result should return the detected language code, which I can then use to provide the answer. If there's an error, I'll need to try another function, but let's start with this one.

The function detected the language as Russian (ru). Now I need to present this result to the user.
