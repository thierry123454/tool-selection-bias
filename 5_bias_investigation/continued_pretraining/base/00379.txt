 
Okay, let's see. The user wants to identify the language of the text 'यह एक हिंदी वाक्य है'. First, I need to figure out which tool to use. There are several language detection functions available. Let me check their descriptions.

The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' tool is for detecting language using the translate_v3 API. The 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' is another option. There's also 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language', 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector', and 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas'.
