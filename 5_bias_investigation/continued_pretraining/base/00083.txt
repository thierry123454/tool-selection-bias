First, I need to check which tools are available for language detection. The user provided several APIs, so I'll review them to pick the most suitable one. The options include translate_all_languages, text_language_by_api_ninjas, what_s_language, quick_language_detector, and translate_v3. Each has its own parameters and descriptions.

The sentence given is "Hello, how are you today?" which is a common English greeting. To confirm, I should use a reliable method. The translate_all_languages API's detect function seems appropriate because it's designed for detecting the language of a text. It also mentions that if the language isn't known, it can still detect it. 

I'll call the detect_for_translate_all_languages function with the provided text. The response should return the detected language. Since the sentence is in English, the result should clearly indicate that. Once I get the result, I can finalize the answer using the Finish function to inform the user of the detected language.
