The first function is 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language', which detects the language code. The second is 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector', which gives confidence scores.

Action
detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input:
{"text": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous?"}

Wait, the function 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' requires a 'detectedcount' parameter. I forgot to include it. Let me adjust the parameters to include 'detectedcount' as 1.

Thought:
I need to include the 'detectedcount' parameter for the 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' function. Let me set it to 1 to detect the language of the given text.

Action
detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input:
{"text": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous?", "detectedcount": 1}
