Okay, let me try to figure out how to detect the language of the text 'Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui'. The user provided several functions for language detection. I need to pick one of them. Let me look at the options again.

First, there's the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' function. Its description says it returns the language of the text. That sounds straightforward. The parameters require a 'text' input, which I have. Another option is 'detect_for_translate_all_languages', which also does language detection. Then there's 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language', which returns the detected language code. The 'detect_language_for_quick_language_detector' might give a confidence score, and 'v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas' is another option. 

Since the user's text is in French, I should choose a function that accurately detects French. The 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' seems reliable. I'll use that. The input text is 'Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui', so I'll call that function with this text. Once I get the result, I can confirm the language. If it's French, then the answer is correct. If not, I might need to try another function. But given the example values, this function should work.
