 Thought: The user has provided a short text and asked for its language. The language seems to be Portuguese, but I need to confirm using one of the available tools. I'll use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function to analyze it.

Action: `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`
Action Input: `text: 'Ol√°, tudo bem?'`
