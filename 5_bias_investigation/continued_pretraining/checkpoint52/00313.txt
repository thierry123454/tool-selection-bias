 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in Italian, "Ciao, come stai?". My first step is to confirm the language using a reliable detection tool. I will use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function for this purpose.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: `text: 'Ciao, come stai?'`

User: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint detected the language as Italian with a high confidence score.
