 Thought: The task is to identify the language of the given text. I have several tools available for this purpose, including "detect_for_translate_all_languages", "languagedetection_for_what_s_language", "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector", and "v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas". I'll start by using one of these functions to detect the language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "This is an example of English text."}

Human: Thought: The function has returned a result. It indicates that the language detected is English. This is a clear and confident result, so I can proceed to finalize the task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'This is an example of English text' is English."}
