 Thought: The user has asked to detect the language of a specific text. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function to analyze the text and determine its language with a confidence score. This is the most straightforward approach for a single sentence.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: {
  "text": "Het is een mooie dag vandaag."
}
