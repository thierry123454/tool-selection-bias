 Thought: The user has asked to identify the language of the phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'. This is a straightforward request, and I can use one of the available language detection tools to achieve this. The phrase appears to be German, but I need to confirm this programmatically. I will select a tool that is reliable for this specific task.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas

Action Input: text: 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'

User: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint detected the language as German with a high confidence score.
