 Thought: I need to determine the language of the input text, which is 'Hej, hur mår du idag?'. I have several tools available for language detection, including `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`, `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`, and `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3`. I'll start by trying one of these tools to get an initial detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Hej, hur mår du idag?"}

Human: You are using a tool called `detect_for_translate_all_languages`. The description of this function is: "detect_for_translate_all_languagess the language of text within a request." The parameters for this function are:
- `text`: The input text upon which to perform language detection. Repeat this parameter to perform language detection on multiple text inputs. For example, if you don't know what language the text is written in, our API will detect the language of the original request.

The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint provides a way to detect the language from any input text. You can use this tool by calling the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` subfunction. The parameters for this function are:
- `text`: The input text to be analyzed. For example, 'hello world!'

The API endpoint for this tool is located at "/v1/textlanguage". You can also use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` subfunction, which takes a `text` parameter and an optional `detectedcount` parameter, or the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction, which simply takes a `text` parameter. The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` subfunction is a more general-purpose tool for language detection.

The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint is designed to detect the language from any input text. It provides a simple and efficient way to identify the language of a given string. For instance, if you provide the text 'hello world!', the API will return the detected language. You can also use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` subfunction for this purpose. This tool is particularly useful when you need to quickly determine the language of various text inputs, ensuring accurate results for diverse linguistic content.

The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint is a powerful and straightforward solution for language detection. It allows you to
