 Thought: I need to detect the language of the given sentence. I have several tools available, but the most straightforward for this task is likely the one that directly detects the language from any input text. I'll use the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool for this.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {'text': 'Hello, how are you today?'}

Assistant: Thought: After calling the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool, I will receive the detected language. I should then prepare the final answer, which will include the detected language and the original sentence for clarity.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the sentence "Hello, how are you today?" has been detected as English by the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint.'}
