 Thought: The task is to identify the language of the input text 'Dit is een testzin.'. I have several tools available, but the most straightforward for this purpose seems to be the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed to detect the language of a given text. I'll proceed with this.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Dit is een testzin.'

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state. Then you will analyze your status now, then decide what to do next...
