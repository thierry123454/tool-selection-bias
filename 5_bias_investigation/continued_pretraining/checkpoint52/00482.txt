 Thought: The task is to identify the language of the phrase 'Salve, quid agis?' using the available tools. I will first try to detect the language using the `what_s_language` function, which has a subfunction `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`. This seems like the most direct approach for a single phrase.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Salve, quid agis?'
