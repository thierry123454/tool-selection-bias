 Thought: I need to determine the language of the given phrase. I have several tools available, and I should choose one that seems most straightforward for this task. The phrase is 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'. It looks like German, but I want to confirm. I'll try the `what_s_language` function first, which is designed to detect the language of a given text. It seems to be a direct fit for this purpose.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` function has returned 'de' for the input 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'. This confirms that the language is indeed German. My task is complete for this specific phrase. I need to ensure I provide the final answer in a clear and concise manner.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the phrase "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?" is German (de).'
