 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, and my task is to determine its language. I have several tools available for language detection, including `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, and `detect_for_translate_all_languages`. I'll start by using `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` for its simplicity and quick response.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: The result from `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` indicates that the language is Italian. This seems straightforward, but I should verify with another tool to ensure accuracy, especially for such a short input.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool also confirms that the language is Italian. This consistency between two different tools increases my confidence in the detection. Now, I need to present this information clearly to the user.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the phrase 'Ciao, come stai?' is Italian."}
