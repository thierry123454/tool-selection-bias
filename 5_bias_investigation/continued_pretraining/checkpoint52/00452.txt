 Thought: The user has provided a text that needs its language detected. The text is 'Привет, как дела?'. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed to detect the language of any given text. This seems like the most direct approach for this specific task.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

User: The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' has been detected as 'ru' (Russian) by the API.
