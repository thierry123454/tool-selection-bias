 Thought: The user has provided a phrase in German: 'Das ist ein schöner Tag'. My first step is to identify the language of this input before attempting any translation. I have several tools available for language detection, each with its own characteristics. I will try to use one of them to detect the language accurately.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Das ist ein schöner Tag'

Assistant: Thought: The API call for language detection has returned a result. I need to analyze the output to confirm the detected language.

Action: I will now analyze the result from the API call for language detection.
