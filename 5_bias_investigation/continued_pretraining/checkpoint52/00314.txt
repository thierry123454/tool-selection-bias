 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in Korean. My first step is to detect its language using one of the available language detection tools. I'll choose the most straightforward one for this initial check.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?'

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has returned the language as Korean. This confirms that the input text is indeed in Korean. Now, I need to decide if I should proceed with any translation or simply confirm the language detection.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the phrase '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?' is Korean.
