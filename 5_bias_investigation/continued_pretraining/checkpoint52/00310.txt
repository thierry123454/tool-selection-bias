 Thought: The user wants me to identify the language of a specific phrase. I need to use a tool designed for language detection. The phrase provided is 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'. I will use the `what_s_language` tool, which is specifically designed to detect the language of a given text. I'll pass the phrase directly to the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: `text: 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'`

Assistant: Thought: The API has returned the detected language. I need to analyze the result to confirm the language and proceed accordingly. If the detection is accurate, I can use it to inform further actions, such as translation if needed. If there's any ambiguity or error, I might need to try an alternative detection method.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: `return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' is German.`
