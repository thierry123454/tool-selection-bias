 Thought: The user has asked to identify the language of a specific phrase. The phrase provided is 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'. To accurately determine its language, I should leverage one of the language detection tools available. Given the context, it's likely that the phrase is in German, but I need to confirm this programmatically. I'll proceed by calling the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function, which is specifically designed for this purpose.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text="Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"

Assistant: Thought: The result from the language detection tool should now be available. Once I receive it, I will analyze the detected language and its confidence score to confirm if it is indeed German or if there's any ambiguity. If the confidence is high and the detected language is German, I can confidently proceed. If not, I might need to consider alternative methods or tools to ensure accuracy.
