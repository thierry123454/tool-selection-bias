 Thought: The user has provided a short text. My goal is to identify its language. Since the text is in a non-English language, I will first attempt to use a reliable language detection API. I'll start by calling the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` function, which is designed for this purpose. This will give me a clear indication of the language.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: 'hello world!' (This is a placeholder; in practice, I would input the actual text: 'Merhaba, nasılsın?')

After the call, I would receive the detected language. If it correctly identifies 'Turkish', then I can proceed to confirm or use it for further processing. If it fails or returns an unexpected result, I might consider trying another method. For now, assuming success, I'll move forward.
