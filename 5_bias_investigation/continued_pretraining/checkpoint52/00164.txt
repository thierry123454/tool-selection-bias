 Thought: The user has provided a short text snippet, and my primary goal is to accurately detect its language. Given the available tools, I'll first consider using the `quick_language_detector` or `text_language_by_api_ninjas` for a quick initial assessment. If the confidence is low or if I need a more robust detection, I might then use `translate_v3` or `translate_all_languages` to confirm. For now, I'll opt for `quick_language_detector` as it seems straightforward for this task.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Ol√°, tudo bem?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `quick_language_detector` API call has returned a result. I need to analyze the detected language and its confidence score to determine if the detection is reliable. If the confidence is high, I can proceed with that detection. If not, I might need to consider alternative methods or a second opinion from another tool.

Action: analyze_result
Action Input: The result from the `quick_language_detector` API call.
