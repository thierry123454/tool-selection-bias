 Thought: The user has asked for the language of the phrase 'Merhaba, nas覺ls覺n?'. To accurately determine this, I will first attempt to use the quick_language_detector API. It's designed to identify the language from a few sentences and provide a confidence score, which seems ideal for this task.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: "text": "Merhaba, nas覺ls覺n?"
