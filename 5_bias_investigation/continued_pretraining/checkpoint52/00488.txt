 Thought: The user wants to know the language of the phrase 'Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?'. I need to detect the language accurately. I have several tools available, but I'll start with the most straightforward one for language detection. I'll use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tool, which is specifically designed to detect the language of a given text.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: text="Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?"

Assistant: Thought: I've just received the result from the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tool. It has identified the language as German. This is a clear and direct answer, but I should consider if there's any further context or if the user expects more details. For now, I'll proceed with this detection.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of the phrase 'Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?' is German."
