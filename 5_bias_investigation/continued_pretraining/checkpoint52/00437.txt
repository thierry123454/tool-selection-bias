 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase that needs language identification. I will first attempt to use the `quick_language_detector` tool, which is designed to detect the language from any input text, providing a confidence score. This seems like the most straightforward approach for a single, short input. If it yields a confident result, I will proceed. If not, I will consider other tools.

Action: `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`
Action Input: `text: "Hej, hur m√•r du idag?"`
