 Thought: The task is to detect the language of the input text. The text provided is 'Olá, tudo bem?'. For this, I will use the "what_s_language" tool, which has a subfunction "languagedetection_for_what_s_language". This tool is designed to detect the language of a given text. I will provide the text directly to this function.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Olá, tudo bem?'

Assistant: Thought: The system has now called the "what_s_language" tool. It will return the detected language code. I will analyze the result to confirm the language and proceed accordingly.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The detected language is Portuguese. The text 'Olá, tudo bem?' is in Portuguese, as it uses common Portuguese greetings and phrases.'
