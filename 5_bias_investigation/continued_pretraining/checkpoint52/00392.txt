 Thought: The user has asked me to detect the language of a specific sentence. I need to identify which language this sentence is written in. To do this, I will use the available tools that are designed for language detection. I'll start by trying the most straightforward method.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: 'Hello, how are you today?'

Assistant: Thought: The API returned the detected language as English. This seems straightforward, but I should confirm if this is consistent with other language detection methods to ensure accuracy. I will now proceed to verify this result using another tool.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: 'Hello, how are you today?'

Assistant: Thought: The second API also detected the language as English. This consistency strengthens my confidence in the result. However, it's always good practice to cross-verify, especially with complex texts. I will attempt one more detection using a different tool to ensure no discrepancies arise.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: 'Hello, how are you today?'

Assistant: Thought: The third language detection tool has also identified the language as English. All three methods have consistently returned the same result, which is a strong indicator of accuracy. Therefore, I can confidently conclude that the language of the sentence 'Hello, how are you today?' is English.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the sentence "Hello, how are you today?" is English.'}
