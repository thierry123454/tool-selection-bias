 Thought: The user has provided a text snippet that appears to be in Korean. My first step is to confirm the language using one of the available language detection tools. I will use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction for this purpose.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.'

Human: Thought: The system has returned the detected language as Korean. This confirms my initial assumption. The next step is to translate this text into English, as the user might need an English version. I will proceed with the `translate_v3` tool, specifically using the `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` subfunction to ensure accurate translation.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.'

Human: Thought: The language detection step for translation was successful, confirming it as Korean. Now, I will call the `translate_v3` function to translate the text from Korean to English. This will provide the user with the English equivalent of the original text.

Action: translate_v3
Action Input: '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.', 'en' (target language code)

Human: Thought: The translation process is complete. The text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.' has been successfully translated to 'Hello, how are you?' This meets the user's requirement for translation. The final step is to package this result and return it to the user using the `Finish` function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The text "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다." has been translated to "Hello, how are you?". This is the English equivalent of the original Korean phrase.'
