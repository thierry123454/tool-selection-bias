 Thought: I need to identify the language of the given text. I have several tools available, but the most straightforward for this specific task seems to be the dedicated language detection function. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` subfunction for this purpose.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="Este es un texto de ejemplo"
