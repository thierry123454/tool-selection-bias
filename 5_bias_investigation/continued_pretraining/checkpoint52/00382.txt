 Thought: I need to determine the language of the provided text, which is "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?". Since there are several language detection tools available, I'll consider the most straightforward approach first. The quick_language_detector seems promising as it directly analyzes text and provides a confidence score. I'll use it for this initial check.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?"}

Assistant: Thought: The quick_language_detector has returned a result. I need to interpret the output to confirm the language. If the confidence score is high, I can be confident in the result. If not, I might need to try another method or consider the possibility of mixed languages, though this text appears to be in a single language. For now, I'll proceed with the detected language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?' is French."}
