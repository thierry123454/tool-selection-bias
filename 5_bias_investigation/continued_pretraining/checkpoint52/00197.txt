 Thought: The user has provided a text in Cyrillic script, and my goal is to determine its language.

This tool is specifically designed to detect the language from any input text, making it an ideal first choice for this task.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'
