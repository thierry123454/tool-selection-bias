 Thought: The user has provided a short piece of text. My initial step is to detect its language. I will use one of the available language detection tools for this purpose, as it's a direct requirement. I'll start by trying the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it's the most straightforward for language detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Je suis tr√®s heureux aujourd'hui"}

Assistant: Thought: The system has just returned the result of the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function. It will now provide the detected language. I need to analyze this result to confirm the language and then move forward. If the detection is accurate, I can proceed with any subsequent translation or analysis. If there's an error or ambiguity, I might need to consider alternative detection methods or confirm with the user.

Action: I will now analyze the output from the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function.
