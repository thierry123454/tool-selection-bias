 Thought: The user has provided a string of text and explicitly asked for its language detection. My first step should be to identify the language of this input. I have several language detection tools available, and I'll start by trying the most straightforward one, which is the `what_s_language` tool. This tool is designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code. I'll use its subfunction `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` for this purpose.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {'text': 'Este es un texto de ejemplo.'}

Assistant: Thought: After using the `what_s_language` tool, I now have the detected language. The next step is to confirm the accuracy of this detection, especially since multiple tools are available. I can also explore other tools like `quick_language_detector` or `text_language_by_api_ninjas` to cross-verify the result. For now, I'll proceed with the detected language from `what_s_language` and see if it aligns with my expectations.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The detected language of the input text "Este es un texto de ejemplo." is Spanish (es).'}

Assistant: Thought: The detection was successful, and I've provided the final answer using the `Finish` function. Since the task is complete and I've confirmed the language, there's no need for further processing. I've ensured that the final answer is clear and informative for the user.
