 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and I need to determine its language. I have several tools available, but for a quick and potentially accurate result, I'll start with "quick_language_detector" as it seems designed for this purpose. I'll feed it the text 'Ciao, come stai?'. If it's accurate enough, I'll use the result directly. If not, I'll fall back to other options.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint is another reliable option. I'll try it as a secondary check. I'll use the "text_language_by_api_ninjas" function with the same input text. This will provide an alternative perspective on the language detection.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: The "translate_v3" tool offers language detection as a subfunction. I'll use the "fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3" function to see if it provides a consistent result with the previous two. This is a good cross-verification step.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: For a more specialized approach, I'll try the "translate_all_languages" tool, specifically its "detect_for_translate_all_languages" function. This might offer a different confidence score or a slightly different language identification, which could be useful for validation.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: Finally, I'll use "what_s_language" for its specific purpose of detecting the language of a given text. This will give me one more data point to confirm the language. All these results will be compared to ensure accuracy.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: Now that I have results from all five language detection tools, I need to analyze them. If all tools consistently identify the same language with high confidence, I can confidently provide that answer. If there's a discrepancy, I'll need to determine which tool is most reliable for this specific input or consider the possibility of an ambiguous input.
