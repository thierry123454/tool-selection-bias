 Thought: I need to determine the language of the provided text: 'Dit is een testzin in het Nederlands'. To do this effectively, I should first identify which language detection tool is most suitable and efficient for this task. I have several options, including `what_s_language`, `quick_language_detector`, and `text_language_by_api_ninjas`. Each has its own characteristics, but for a quick and reliable detection, `quick_language_detector` seems promising, as it provides a confidence score, which is valuable for accuracy. I'll proceed with `quick_language_detector`.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: 'Dit is een testzin in het Nederlands'

Assistant: Thought: The text 'Dit is een testzin in het Nederlands' is quite short, which might impact the confidence score, but `quick_language_detector` is designed to handle such inputs. I'll send it through and see the result, then decide if further steps are necessary.
