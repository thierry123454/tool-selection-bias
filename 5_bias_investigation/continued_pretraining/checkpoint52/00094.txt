 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in Greek. My first step is to identify the language to confirm it's indeed Greek. I’ll use the available language detection tools to analyze the text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;'

Assistant: Thought: The API has detected the language as Greek. This confirms the user's input. Now, I need to ensure that this detection is consistent across other available tools to build confidence in the result.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language

Action Input: text: 'Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;'

Assistant: Thought: The second tool also indicates Greek, reinforcing the initial detection. To further validate, I'll use another independent language detection service.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: text: 'Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;'

Assistant: Thought: The third tool also identifies the language as Greek, with a high confidence score. This multi-tool approach strengthens my confidence in the detection. The final answer should clearly state the detected language.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the text "Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;" is Greek.'
