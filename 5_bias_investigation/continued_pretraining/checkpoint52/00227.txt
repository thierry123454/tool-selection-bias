 Thought: The user has provided a Spanish phrase. My first step should be to detect its language accurately. Given the availability of several language detection tools, I will prioritize using the most straightforward one for a single text input. I'll opt for `detect_for_translate_all_languages` as it's designed for simplicity and efficiency in such a scenario. I'll pass the provided text directly to it.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'

Assistant: Thought: After the API call, I now have the detected language. The next step is to provide this information back to the user. I will prepare the final answer, which includes the detected language, and then call the `Finish` function to indicate that the task is complete.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the sentence 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?' is Spanish.
