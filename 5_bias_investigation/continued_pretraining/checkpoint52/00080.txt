 Thought: I need to determine the language of the input text 'Ciao, come va?'. I have several tools available, but the most straightforward for this task is likely to be one of the language detection APIs. I'll consider the options and choose the most appropriate one for this specific query.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text='Ciao, come va?'

After the call, I will get the language detection result from the API.
