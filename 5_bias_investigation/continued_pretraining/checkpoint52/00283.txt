 Thought: The user has provided a text in Hebrew. My first step is to detect its language accurately. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed for language detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'שלום, מה שלומך היום?'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has successfully identified the language as Hebrew. Now, I can proceed with any further actions, such as translating it or confirming the detection. For now, I'll confirm the language and then proceed.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the text "שלום, מה שלומך היום?" is Hebrew.'
