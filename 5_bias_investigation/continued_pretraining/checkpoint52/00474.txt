 Thought: The task is to detect the language of the given sentence. I will use the `what_s_language` tool, which internally uses the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction. The input text is 'This is a sample English sentence.' The language detection should be straightforward for this common phrase.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: 'This is a sample English sentence.'
