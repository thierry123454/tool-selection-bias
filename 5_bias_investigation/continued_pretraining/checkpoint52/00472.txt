 Thought: The user has requested the detection of the language for a specific text. The text provided is 'Это тестовое предложение'. To accurately determine its language, I will first attempt to use a reliable language detection tool. I will prioritize using the `quick_language_detector` API, as it is designed to detect the language from any input text and provides a confidence score. If that tool is not available or fails, I will then consider using the `what_s_language` tool, which is also specifically designed for language detection. My goal is to identify the language with the highest confidence.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: 'Это тестовое предложение'

Assistant: Thought: I've just called the `quick_language_detector` API with the input text 'Это тестовое предложение'. The API is designed to detect the language from any input text and return a confidence score. I will now analyze the result to determine the detected language and its confidence level. If the confidence score is high, I can proceed with certainty. If it's low, I might need to consider alternative methods or confirm with the user if they have a preferred language. For now, I'm waiting for the API response.

Action: detect_language_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Это тестовое предложение'

Assistant: Thought: The `quick_language_detector` API has returned a result. I will now use the `what_s_language` tool as a secondary check to confirm the detection. The `what_s_language` tool is specifically designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code. This will provide an independent verification of the language, which is crucial for accuracy, especially when dealing with multilingual text or ambiguous input. I will compare the results from both APIs to ensure consistency.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Это тестовое предложение'

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` tool has also provided its detection. Now, I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` subfunction from the `translate_all_languages` API. This API is known for its robust language detection capabilities, often used as a fallback or for more complex scenarios. By running the text through this API, I can cross-verify the language detection from both `quick_language_detector` and `what_s_language`. This multi-tool approach ensures the highest accuracy for the language identification of 'Это тестовое предложение'.
