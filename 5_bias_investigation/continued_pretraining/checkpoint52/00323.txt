 Thought: The user has asked for the language of the sentence 'Ciao, come stai?'. To determine this, I'll first consider using the `what_s_language` tool, which is designed to detect the language of a given text. This seems like the most direct approach for this specific query. I will feed the sentence directly into this tool to get the detected language.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: 'Ciao, come stai?'

Assistant: Thought: I've just called the `what_s_language` tool with the input 'Ciao, come stai?'. The tool is designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code. I expect it to identify the language accurately. If it fails or returns an unexpected result, I'll need to consider alternative methods or restart the process. For now, I'll proceed with the result.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the sentence "Ciao, come stai?" is Italian.'}
