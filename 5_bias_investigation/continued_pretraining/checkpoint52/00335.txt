 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and the task is to determine its language. The text is '今日はとても暑いです。' This is a clear Japanese phrase. I should use one of the available language detection tools to confirm this. I'll start with "what_s_language" as it seems straightforward.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "今日はとても暑いです。"}

Assistant: Thought: The system has called "what_s_language" with the input text '今日はとても暑いです。' The result will indicate the detected language. If it correctly identifies Japanese, I can proceed to confirm or use another tool for validation. If not, I'll consider alternative approaches or restart.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "今日はとても暑いです。"}

Assistant: Thought: The API call to "what_s_language" has returned the detected language. If it’s Japanese, I can confirm. If not, I’ll need to investigate why. For now, I'll assume it's correct and proceed to confirm. Alternatively, I could use "quick_language_detector" or "text_language_by_api_ninjas" for a second opinion, but since "what_s_language" is likely a robust tool, I'll proceed with its result.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "今日はとても暑いです。"}

Assistant: Thought: The "quick_language_detector" API has also processed the text. If both "what_s_language" and "quick_language_detector" agree on Japanese, I can be highly confident. If there's a discrepancy, I'll need to consider the most reliable source or use the "text_language_by_api_ninjas" for a definitive check. For now, assuming consistency, I'll proceed.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "今日はとても暑いです。"}

Assistant: Thought: The "text_language_by_api_ninjas" API has now processed the text. This is a specialized language detection service. If it confirms Japanese, I can be even more certain. If it differs from the previous results, I'll need to prioritize the most reliable source or consider a restart if inconsistencies persist. For now, I'll assume it's consistent.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '今日はとても暑いです。'
