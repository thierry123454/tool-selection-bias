 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in German. My first step should be to confirm the language using a reliable detection tool. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function for this purpose. Once the language is confirmed, I can then proceed with any further translation or analysis if needed.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Das ist ein sch√∂ner Tag.'
