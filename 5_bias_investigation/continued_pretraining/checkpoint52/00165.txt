 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and the task is to determine its language. To begin, I should first detect the language of the given text. I have several tools available for language detection, and I'll need to choose the most appropriate one for this initial step. I'll consider the capabilities and accuracy of each.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: text: 'Merhaba, nasılsın?'

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` indicates that the language is detected as "Turkish" with a high confidence score. This is a promising start, as it suggests that the initial detection is quite accurate. However, to ensure robustness, especially for very short texts, I might consider using another detection method as a secondary check. For now, I'll proceed with this detection and then confirm it using another tool if necessary.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3

Action Input: text: 'Merhaba, nasılsın?'

Assistant: Thought: The `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function also identifies the language as "Turkish." This consistency across two different language detection tools significantly increases my confidence in the result. Given this, I can now confidently proceed to provide the final answer, as the task is to simply tell the language of the text.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of the text 'Merhaba, nasılsın?' is Turkish."
