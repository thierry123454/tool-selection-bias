 Thought: The user has provided a sentence, and my first step is to identify its language. Given the nature of the tools available, it makes sense to start with a quick language detection API. I'll use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function for this initial attempt.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {
  "text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag."
}

Human: Thought: The task is to identify the language of the given text. I've just initiated a call to the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function with the input text "Das ist ein schöner Tag." I anticipate a quick response indicating the detected language and a confidence score. If the detection is accurate, I can proceed with the next steps. If not, I might need to try an alternative method or confirm the result.

Action: None (waiting for the result of the call)
