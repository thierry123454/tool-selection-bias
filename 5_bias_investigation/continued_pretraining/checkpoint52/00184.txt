 Thought: The user has provided a short string of characters, and my task is to determine the language it is written in. Before proceeding, I need to identify which of the available language detection tools is most suitable for this task. The options include "what_s_language," "quick_language_detector," "text_language_by_api_ninjas," and "translate_v3." Each has its own description and parameters, and I need to choose the most appropriate one for this specific input. The input is a single word, "Это пример текста," which appears to be in Cyrillic, suggesting a language like Russian or Ukrainian. I'll consider the simplicity and accuracy of each tool for such a short and potentially ambiguous input.

Action: I will use the "detect_language_for_translate_v3" function, as it is specifically designed to detect the language of a given text and seems to be a direct and reliable choice for this task. This function is part of the "translate_v3" tool, which is described as an "Easy and reliable Machine Translation and Language Detection" service.

Action Input: {"text": "Это пример текста."}

Assistant: Thought: The function "detect_language_for_translate_v3" has been called with the input text "Это пример текста." Now, I need to wait for the result from the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint. This result will provide the detected language code and, ideally, a confidence score. Based on this output, I will then proceed to either confirm the language or decide if a secondary check is necessary, especially if the confidence score is low or if the language is ambiguous.

Action: Wait for the result from the "detect_language_for_translate_v3" function.
