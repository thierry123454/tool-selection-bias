 Thought: I need to determine the language of the provided text. There are several tools available, but I'll start with the most straightforward one for language detection. I'll use the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` function, which is designed to detect the language from any input text. This should give me a quick initial result.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'This is an example of English text'

Assistant: Thought: The output from the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint should provide the detected language. I'll analyze the result to confirm it's English and then proceed with any further steps if needed.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'This is an example of English text'

Assistant: Thought: The result from the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint indicates that the text is indeed English. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and I've successfully done that, I can now conclude the task. I'll use the `Finish` function to provide the final answer and signal the end of this attempt.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the text "This is an example of English text" is English.'
