 Thought: The user has provided a short text snippet. My first step is to identify the language of this text. Given the characters, it's likely a non-English language, but I need confirmation. I will use the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool for this initial detection.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool has successfully identified the language. Now, I need to confirm if this is the correct language or if there's any ambiguity. For a more robust confirmation, I might consider using another language detection tool, but for now, I'll proceed with the result from `text_language_by_api_ninjas`.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian, as detected by the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint."}

Assistant: Thought: The task is now complete. I've successfully identified the language using the appropriate tool and provided the final answer. The user should now have the information they need.
