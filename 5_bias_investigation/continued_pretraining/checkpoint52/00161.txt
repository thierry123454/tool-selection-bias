 Thought: The user has provided a short message, and my initial goal is to determine its language. Given the prompt, I should use a language detection tool. Among the available options, `quick_language_detector` seems suitable for this initial, quick analysis. I’ll feed the text into this tool to get a confidence score and an identified language.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: "Ciao, come va?"

Assistant: Thought: The result from `quick_language_detector` should give me the detected language and a confidence score. If the confidence is high, I can proceed with a more detailed translation or further processing. If it's low, I might need to try an alternative tool or consider the context. For now, I'll assume the result is reliable and move forward.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: "Ciao, come va?"

Assistant: Thought: Using `text_language_by_api_ninjas` for a secondary check is a good idea to confirm the initial detection. If both tools agree, I can be more confident in the result. If they differ, I’ll need to investigate further, perhaps by looking at longer text or using a different method.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: text: "Ciao, come va?"

Assistant: Thought: The `translate_v3` tool also offers language detection. This is another cross-verification point. If all three tools point to the same language, I can confidently proceed. If there's a discrepancy, I'll need to consider the context or the quality of the input text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: "Ciao, come va?"

Assistant: Thought: Finally, I'll use `translate_all_languages` to double-check. This tool is known for its accuracy and might provide a definitive answer. If all tools consistently identify the language, I can move to the next step. If not, I might need to reconsider my approach or acknowledge the ambiguity.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: "Ciao, come va?"

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` tool is another option for language detection. It’s straightforward and should provide a clear language code. If all tools now agree on the language, I can proceed with the next step, which might involve translation or further analysis. If there's still inconsistency, I might need to flag the text for human
