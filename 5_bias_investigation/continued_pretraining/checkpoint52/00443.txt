 Thought:
The user has provided a short phrase in Italian. My first step is to detect the language of this input. Iâ€™ll use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function, which is specifically designed for this purpose.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: `text: 'Ciao, come stai oggi?'`
