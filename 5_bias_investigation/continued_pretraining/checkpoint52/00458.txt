 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Cyrillic script, which is a strong indicator of a Slavic language. My first step should be to confirm the language using one of the available language detection tools. I will choose to use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is specifically designed for this purpose and provides a straightforward detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has returned the language as 'ru' (Russian). This confirms that the text is indeed in Russian. Now that I have identified the language, the next step would be to confirm this detection using another tool to ensure accuracy, or to proceed with any subsequent translation or processing steps if required by the task. For now, I will proceed with the confirmation of the language.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the text "Привет, как дела?" is Russian (RU).'
