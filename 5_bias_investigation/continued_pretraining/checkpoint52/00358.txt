 Thought: The user has provided a text in Korean. My first step is to confirm the language using one of the available tools. I'll use the `detect_language_for_translate_v3` function, as it's specifically designed for fast language detection and seems reliable for this purpose.

Action: detect_language_for_translate_v3
Action Input: text: '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?'

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
