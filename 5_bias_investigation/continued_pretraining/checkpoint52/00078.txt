 Thought: The user has provided a short text snippet that requires language identification. My first step should be to determine the language of this input. I have several tools available for this purpose, and I need to choose the most appropriate one based on speed and accuracy for a single, short text. Given that `quick_language_detector` is designed to detect language from a few sentences and provide a confidence score, it seems well-suited for this initial quick analysis. I will use `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` to get an immediate result.

Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: The `quick_language_detector` has returned the language as Russian with a high confidence score. This is a clear and definitive result for this short text. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and we have a precise answer, I can now proceed to `Finish` to provide the final result. There's no need for further steps or alternative tools, as the language has been accurately determined.
