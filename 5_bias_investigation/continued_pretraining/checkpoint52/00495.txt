 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in Spanish, and the task is to detect its language. Since the sentence is relatively short, I'll use the "detect_for_translate_all_languages" API, which is designed for language detection, to identify the language. This tool is specifically built for such a purpose and should give me an accurate result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Hola, ¿cómo estás hoy?'

Assistant: Thought: The API call has returned the language as Spanish. This confirms my initial assumption. Now, I need to ensure that the detection is consistent across different tools, but for this specific task, the primary goal is to detect the language, and I've successfully done that.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the sentence 'Hola, ¿cómo estás hoy?' is Spanish.
