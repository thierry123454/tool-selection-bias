 Thought: The user has provided a text in Korean. My first step is to confirm the language using a reliable tool. I'll use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function to analyze the text and get its language.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: text="안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어떠세요?"
