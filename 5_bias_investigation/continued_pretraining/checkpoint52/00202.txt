 Thought: The user has asked me to identify the language of a specific sentence. The sentence provided is "Ciao, come stai oggi?". To accurately determine the language, I should consider using a dedicated language detection tool. Among the available options, the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` and `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` seem particularly suited for this task. I will first attempt to use `detect_for_translate_all_languages` as it appears to be a primary tool for language detection. If it fails or provides an unexpected result, I will then consider `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` as an alternative. My goal is to reliably detect the language before proceeding with any translation if needed.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: "Ciao, come stai oggi?"

Assistant: Thought: The output from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the language of the text "Ciao, come stai oggi?" is Italian. This is a clear and definitive result. Given that the task is simply to identify the language, and I have successfully detected it as Italian, I now have the necessary information to provide the user with an accurate answer. There is no need to proceed to a translation step or attempt an alternative detection method, as the language has already been confidently identified. My next step is to prepare the final answer and call the `Finish` function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of the sentence 'Ciao, come stai oggi?' is Italian."
