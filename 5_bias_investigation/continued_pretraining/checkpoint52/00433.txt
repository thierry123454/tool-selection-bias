 Thought: I need to determine the language of the provided text. The text is 'Bonjour tout le monde'. It seems to be a common greeting in French. To confirm, I'll use the appropriate language detection tool.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {'text': 'Bonjour tout le monde'}

User: The language of the text 'Bonjour tout le monde' is detected as 'fr-FR' (French - France).
