 Thought: The user has provided a phrase, and my task is to determine its language. The phrase given is 'Olá, como você está hoje?'. I need to use an appropriate tool for language detection. I have several options, but I'll start with the most straightforward one that directly translates to the task of identifying the language of any input text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: 'Olá, como você está hoje?'

Assistant: Thought: I've just called the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function with the provided text. It's designed to detect the language of any input text. If the API returns a language code, that's my answer. If it doesn't, or if there's an error, I'll need to consider alternative methods or confirm the input. For now, I'll proceed with the result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: 'Olá, como você está hoje?'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has returned a language code. I need to verify if it's accurate and if it directly indicates the language of the input text. If it's not the expected language, or if there's ambiguity, I might need to try another tool. For now, I'll treat the result as the definitive answer.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: 'Olá, como você está hoje?'

Assistant: Thought: The language detected by `detect_for_translate_all_languages` is Portuguese. This aligns perfectly with the input text 'Olá, como você está hoje?'. I now have a clear answer to the user's query. The next step is to confirm this with the user or provide a more detailed response if needed. However, since the task is simply to find out the language, and I've done that, I can now proceed to the final step.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the phrase "Olá, como você está hoje?" is Portuguese.'}
