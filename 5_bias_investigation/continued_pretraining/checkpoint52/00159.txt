 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in Swedish. My first step is to confirm the language using one of the available language detection tools. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function for this initial check.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Hej, hur m√•r du?"}
