 Thought: The user has provided a text in Japanese. My first step should be to detect the language accurately. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is specifically designed for language detection, to identify the language of the given text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: '今日はとてもいい天気です'
