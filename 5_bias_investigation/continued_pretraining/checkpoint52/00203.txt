 Thought: The user has provided a short Japanese phrase. To determine its language, I should first detect the language using a suitable tool. Since the text is already in a language, I need to identify if it's Japanese. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function for this initial detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: '今日はとてもいい天気です'

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the text is indeed Japanese. This confirms the user's query. Now, I need to provide a clear answer to the user, confirming the language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the text '今日はとてもいい天気です' is Japanese.
