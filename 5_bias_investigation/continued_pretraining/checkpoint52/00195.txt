 Thought: The user has provided a phrase that clearly needs language detection. Given the available tools, `quick_language_detector`, `text_language_by_api_ninjas`, `translate_v3`, `translate_all_languages`, and `what_s_language` are all capable of detecting language. For this initial step, I’ll use `quick_language_detector` as it is straightforward and likely efficient for a single phrase. My goal is to identify the language with reasonable confidence.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag"}

Human: OK, let's proceed. You've just called the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function with the input text "Das ist ein schöner Tag". The result from that call will now be available. Please provide the output from the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function so I can proceed with the next steps.
