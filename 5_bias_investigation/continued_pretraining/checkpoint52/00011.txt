 Thought: The user has provided a sentence, and my primary need is to identify its language. Given the tools available, I can directly use a language detection function to ascertain the language without needing to translate it first. The most straightforward approach here is to use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed for language detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Это пример текста на русском языке'
