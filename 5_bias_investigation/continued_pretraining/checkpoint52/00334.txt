 Thought: I need to identify the language of the given sentence. The sentence is 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function for this purpose, as it is designed to detect the language of a text input.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {'text': 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'}
