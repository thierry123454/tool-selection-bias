 Thought: The user has provided a short piece of text in Swedish. My first step should be to detect the language using one of the available tools. I'll try the `quick_language_detector` with the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` subfunction, as it's designed for this purpose.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Hej, hur m√•r du idag?"}

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
Then you will analyze your status now, then decide what to do next...
After many (Thought-call) pairs, you finally perform the task, then you can give your finial answer.
