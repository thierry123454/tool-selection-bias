 Thought: The user has provided a sentence, and my task is to identify its language. I need to determine which of the available language detection tools is most suitable for this specific piece of text. The sentence 'Je suis très heureux de te voir.' is in French, but I don't know that yet. I should use a tool that can accurately detect the language from any input text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Je suis très heureux de te voir."}

Human: Thought: The API has just returned a result. I need to analyze the output to confirm the detected language. If the detection is accurate, I can proceed with the next steps or confirm the language. If there's an error or ambiguity, I might need to consider alternative methods or retry with different parameters.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Je suis très heureux de te voir."}

Assistant: Thought: The second language detection tool has also provided a result. I should compare the outputs from both tools to ensure consistency. If they agree, I can be more confident in the detected language. If there's a discrepancy, I need to investigate further, perhaps by trying a different tool or method. For now, I'll proceed with the most reliable detection.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'Je suis très heureux de te voir.' is French."}

Assistant: Thought: The task is complete, and I have provided the detected language. I have used the available tools to analyze the input text and confirmed the language. The result is now ready to be presented to the user.
