 Thought: The user has provided a short Japanese text. My first step should be to confirm its language using a reliable language detection tool. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function for this initial check.

Action: `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`

Action Input: {"text": "今日はとても暑いです。"}
