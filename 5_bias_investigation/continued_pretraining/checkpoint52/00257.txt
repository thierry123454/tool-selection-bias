 Thought: The user has provided a phrase in German, and they want me to confirm its language. I should first attempt to detect the language using one of the available tools. Given the nature of the input, I'll try the `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` API, as it's specifically designed for detecting the language of text.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"}

Assistant: Thought: After calling the `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` API, I need to review the response to confirm if it correctly identified the language. If it did, I can proceed to confirm the language with the user. If not, I might need to try an alternative detection method or consider if the input was too short for accurate detection.
