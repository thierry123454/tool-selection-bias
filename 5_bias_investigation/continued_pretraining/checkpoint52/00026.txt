 Thought: The user has provided a phrase, and my task is to determine its language. I will use the available tools to achieve this. The phrase 'Мне нравится читать книги.' appears to be in Cyrillic script, which suggests it might be Russian or another Slavic language. I'll use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` API, which is designed to detect language with a confidence score, to analyze this text.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: text: 'Мне нравится читать книги.'
