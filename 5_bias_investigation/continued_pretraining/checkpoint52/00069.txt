 Thought: The user has provided a text input. My first step is to determine the language of this text. Given the nature of the task and the available tools, I will use the "what_s_language" function, which is designed to detect the language of a given text. This function seems straightforward and directly applicable to the task at hand. I will pass the provided text directly to this function to get the detected language.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text="Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui"

Assistant: Thought: The call to "what_s_language" has returned the detected language. Now, I need to analyze the result. If the language is detected accurately, I can proceed to confirm or use this information for further actions. If there's any ambiguity or an error, I might need to consider alternative approaches or retry with different parameters. For now, I will assume the detection is correct and proceed to confirm the language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The detected language of the text 'Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui' is French."
