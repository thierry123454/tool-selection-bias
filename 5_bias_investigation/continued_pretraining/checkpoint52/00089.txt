 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my goal is to determine its language. Since the text is in Korean, I need to use a reliable language detection tool. I will first attempt to use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is part of the `translate_all_languages` tool, which is specifically designed for language detection. If that doesn't yield a clear result, I will consider alternative tools like `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` or `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: { "text": '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.' }

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has returned the language as Korean. This is a clear and definitive result, so I can confidently proceed with the task. Since the task is simply to detect the language, I have now achieved the objective.

Action: Finish
Action Input: { "return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language of the text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.' is Korean." }
