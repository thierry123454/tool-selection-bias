 Thought: The user has provided a text snippet in Korean, and my task is to detect its language. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` subfunction for this purpose, as it is designed for language detection and is likely to be efficient. I will input the text directly into the function to get the detected language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has returned the language as Korean. This confirms that the text is indeed in Korean. Now, I need to ensure that this detection is consistent across other available tools, just to be thorough. I will also consider the confidence score if one is provided.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.'

Assistant: Thought: The `quick_language_detector` function has also identified the text as Korean, which aligns with the previous detection. This consistency strengthens my confidence in the language identification. The next step would be to proceed with any further actions based on this detected language, such as translation or analysis. However, since the primary task was just detection, I can now consider wrapping up.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The detected language of the text "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다." is Korean.'
