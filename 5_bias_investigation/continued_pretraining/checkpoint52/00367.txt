 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in a language that isn't immediately recognizable to me. My first step should be to determine the language of this input. I can use one of the language detection tools available. Since the sentence is quite short, I'll consider using a tool that is designed to handle such cases efficiently. I'll opt for the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` API, which is specifically designed for language detection. This will give me a clear indication of the language, allowing me to proceed with any subsequent translation or analysis.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Hej, hur mår du?"}

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the sentence "Hej, hur mår du?" is in Swedish. This is a crucial piece of information, as it tells me the source language. My next step would be to confirm this detection or explore other tools if there's any ambiguity. However, given the confidence of this initial detection, I can proceed with the understanding that the language is Swedish. The user's query was to identify the language, and this tool has successfully provided that. Now, I should consider whether there's any further action needed, but since the task was solely to identify the language, and that has been accomplished, I can now finalize the task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'Hej, hur mår du?' is Swedish."}
