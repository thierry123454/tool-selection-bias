 Thought: The user has provided a short text snippet, and my first task is to identify its language. Given the nature of the input, which contains Arabic characters, I can reasonably assume it's Arabic. However, to confirm, I'll use a specialized language detection tool to get an accurate result. This will ensure that my subsequent actions, such as translation, are correctly targeted.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'

Assistant: Thought: The quick language detector has provided a result. I need to analyze the output to determine the detected language and its confidence score. This will help me decide the next steps, whether to proceed with translation or if further confirmation is needed.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'

Assistant: Thought: The detection result indicates a high confidence in identifying the language as Arabic. This aligns with my initial assumption, so I can proceed with confidence. The next logical step would be to translate this Arabic text into a more commonly understood language, such as English, to make it accessible to a wider audience.
