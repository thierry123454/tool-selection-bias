 Thought: I need to detect the language of the input text. The phrase provided is in Korean. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to identify the language. Once I know the language, I can proceed with any subsequent translation or analysis.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of the phrase '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?' is Korean."
