 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, and the task is to detect its language. Given the brevity, a robust detection might be challenging, but we can still attempt it. I'll start by using a straightforward language detection tool, perhaps `what_s_language`, which is designed to detect the language of a given text. If it's accurate, we can proceed; if not, we might need to explore other options or confirm the language manually.

Action: what_s_language

Action Input: text: 'Olá, tudo bem com você?'

Assistant: Thought: The initial detection by `what_s_language` indicates the language is Portuguese. This seems plausible given the input. However, to ensure accuracy, especially with such a short phrase, it might be beneficial to cross-verify with another tool, like `quick_language_detector`, which provides a confidence score. This will help confirm if the detection is robust or if there's any ambiguity.

Action: quick_language_detector

Action Input: text: 'Olá, tudo bem com você?'

Assistant: Thought: The `quick_language_detector` has also identified the language as Portuguese, with a high confidence score. This consistent result across two different tools strengthens my confidence in the detection. Now, the next step would be to confirm if this is indeed the correct language for the input. Given the high confidence and the consistent result, I believe we can proceed with this identification.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' is Portuguese.
