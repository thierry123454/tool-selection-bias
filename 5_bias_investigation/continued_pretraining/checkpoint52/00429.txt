 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Korean. My first step should be to detect the language accurately. I will use the `what_s_language` function, specifically its subfunction `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, to analyze the text. This tool is designed to detect the language from any input text, which seems ideal for this task.

Action: `what_s_language`
Action Input: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language(text='안녕하세요, 반갑습니다')`

User: The language is detected as Korean with a confidence score of 0.99.
