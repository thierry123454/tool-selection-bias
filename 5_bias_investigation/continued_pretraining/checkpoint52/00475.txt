 Thought: The user has asked to detect the language of the phrase 'Olá, tudo bem?'. Given the context, it seems quite likely that this phrase is in Portuguese. To confirm, I will use the `what_s_language` function, which internally uses the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction, to analyze the provided text.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: 'Olá, tudo bem?'
