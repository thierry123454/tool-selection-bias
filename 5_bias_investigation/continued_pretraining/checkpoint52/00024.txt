 Thought: The user has provided a short Latin phrase. My initial goal is to accurately detect its language. Given the available tools, I should first consider which one is most appropriate for this task. The `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool is specifically designed for language detection, and it seems to be a direct fit for this requirement. I will proceed with this tool to analyze the input text.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Salve, quid agis hodie?"}

Assistant: Thought: The API call has returned a result. It indicates that the language of the input text is Latin. This is a positive outcome, as it confirms the language without any ambiguity. Since the task is complete and the language has been successfully identified, I should now proceed to wrap up this attempt and provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the input text 'Salve, quid agis hodie?' is Latin."}
