 Thought: The user has provided a Japanese text. My goal is to identify its language accurately. I can use one of the available language detection tools. I'll start by trying the `translate_v3` tool with its `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` subfunction, as it seems straightforward for this purpose. If it fails or is too slow, I’ll consider alternatives.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: text: '今日は良い天気ですね'

Assistant: Thought: The `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function is now processing the input text. I need to wait for its response to determine the language. If it provides a clear result, I can confirm the language. If it fails or is ambiguous, I’ll try another tool.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: text: '今日は良い天気ですね'

Assistant: Thought: The `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function has returned a result. It identified the language as Japanese. This is a strong indication that the text is indeed written in Japanese. I can now confirm the language and proceed to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the text "今日は良い天気ですね" is Japanese.'
