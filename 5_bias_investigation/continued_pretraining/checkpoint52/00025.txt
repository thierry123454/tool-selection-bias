 Thought: The user has provided a specific text and asked for its language. My first step should be to detect the language using one of the available tools. Given the nature of the input, a direct language detection tool seems most appropriate. I'll use the tool designed for this purpose.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {'text': 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?'}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint is designed specifically for this task, making it a reliable choice for detecting the language from any input text. The input provided is a common French greeting, so I expect the API to return "fr" as the language code. Once I receive the result, I can confirm the language and proceed.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {'text': 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?'}

Assistant: Thought: For added confidence, I'll also use the quick language detector to cross-verify the result. This tool is designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code, which should align with the previous API Ninjas result. If both tools confirm the same language, I can be highly confident in my answer.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {'text': 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?'}

Assistant: Thought: Finally, I'll use the translate_all_languages API to detect the language. This tool is versatile and can handle a wide range of languages, providing a robust confirmation. The confidence score from this tool will be particularly useful in ensuring the accuracy of my final determination.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The text "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?" is written in French. All three tools (text_language_by_api_ninjas, quick_language_detector, and translate_all_languages) consistently identified it as "fr", confirming its language definitively.'}
