 Thought: I need to determine the language of the input text 'Olá, tudo bem?'. For this, I can use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function, which is designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code. This seems like the most straightforward approach for a single text input.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: `text: 'Olá, tudo bem?'`
