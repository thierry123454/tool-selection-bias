 Thought: The user has provided a short text snippet that appears to be in Korean. My first step is to confirm the language using one of the available detection tools. I'll try the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function, which is specifically designed for this purpose.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`

Action Input: '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.'
