 Thought: The input text is in Dutch. I need to confirm the language before proceeding with any translation or further processing. I'll use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tool to detect the language.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Dit is een testzin.'

After the call, I will get the detected language.
