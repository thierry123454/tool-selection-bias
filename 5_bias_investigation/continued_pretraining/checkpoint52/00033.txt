 Thought: The user has asked for the language detection of the text 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'. This appears to be a phrase in Latin. I will use the appropriate language detection tool to identify it. For this, I believe the `what_s_language` tool with its subfunction `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` is suitable for this task.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'

Assistant: Thought: I have just called the language detection function. The result should now be available. I will analyze the output to confirm the language.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'

Assistant: Thought: The result from the language detection function indicates that the text 'Salve, quid agis hodie?' is detected as Latin. This confirms my initial hypothesis. The task is now complete as we have successfully identified the language of the provided text.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the text "Salve, quid agis hodie?" is Latin.'}
