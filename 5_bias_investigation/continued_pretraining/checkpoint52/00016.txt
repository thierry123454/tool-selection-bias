 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and the task is to identify its language. The text is in Arabic, which is common for greetings. I need to confirm the language using one of the available translation or language detection tools.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'

Assistant: Thought: The API call for "detect_for_translate_all_languages" has returned a language code. I need to verify if it's accurate for Arabic.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'

Assistant: Thought: Both API calls for language detection have consistently identified Arabic, which confirms the language of the input text. The task is complete.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the text "مرحبا كيف حالك؟" is Arabic.'
