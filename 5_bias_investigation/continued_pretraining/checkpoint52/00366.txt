 Thought: The user has provided a text in Japanese. My first step is to confirm the language using the available tools. I'll start with the quick_language_detector to get an initial assessment.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "今日はお元気ですか？"}

After the call, I will get the result from quick_language_detector.
