 Thought: The user has provided the input text '今日はいい天気ですね'. My first step should be to determine the language of this text. I have several tools available for language detection, including `what_s_language`, `quick_language_detector`, and `text_language_by_api_ninjas`. I'll start by using `what_s_language` as it seems straightforward for a single text input.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: {'text': '今日はいい天気ですね'}

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` tool has detected the language of '今日はいい天気ですね' as Japanese. This is a good start. Now, I need to confirm this detection or explore other tools to ensure accuracy, especially if the text is ambiguous or if the detection isn't definitive. For now, I'll proceed with this result.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the input text "今日はいい天気ですね" has been detected as Japanese by the `what_s_language` tool. This is a reliable detection for this specific input.'}
