 Thought: The user has provided a short text and explicitly asked for its language. My first step should be to detect the language using one of the available tools. I'll try the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, as it seems straightforward for this purpose. If it doesn't yield a clear result, I'll consider an alternative.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: {"text": "Dit is een testzin in het Nederlands", "detectedcount": 1}
