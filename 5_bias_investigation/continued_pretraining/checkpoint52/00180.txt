 Thought: The user has asked me to detect the language of the sentence 'Hola, ¿cómo estás hoy?'. Since this is a Spanish phrase, I need to confirm its language. I have several options for language detection, including 'quick_language_detector', 'text_language_by_api_ninjas', 'translate_v3', 'translate_all_languages', and 'what_s_language'. I'll try the most straightforward one first, 'quick_language_detector'.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás hoy?"}

User: The language of the text is: 'es'.
