 Thought: The user has provided a sentence, and the task is to determine its language. I will use the available tools to analyze the text. The most straightforward approach is to use a dedicated language detection tool. I will choose the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` function, which is designed for this purpose.

Action: `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`
Action Input: `text: 'Este es un texto en espa√±ol'`
