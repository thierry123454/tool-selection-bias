 Thought: The user has provided a text string, and the task is to detect its language. I need to identify the appropriate tool for this purpose. Given the options, "what_s_language" seems to directly address language detection, and its subfunction `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` is designed for this exact task. I will proceed with this tool.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: `text: 'Het is een mooie dag vandaag.'`

Assistant: Thought: The system has just responded with the detected language for the input text. I will now analyze the result to determine if it's accurate and sufficient for the user's query.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: `return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of 'Het is een mooie dag vandaag.' is Dutch."`
