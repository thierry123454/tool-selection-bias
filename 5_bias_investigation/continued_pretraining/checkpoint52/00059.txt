 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a specific phrase. Since we have several language detection tools available, I'll first try to detect the language using the most straightforward method, which is the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function. This tool is designed to detect the language of text, and it's the most direct path to an answer. I'll pass the phrase 'Je suis très heureux' to this function.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Je suis très heureux"}
