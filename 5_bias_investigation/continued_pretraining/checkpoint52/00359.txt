 Thought: The user has provided a phrase in Spanish, specifically asking for the location of a library. My goal is to detect the language of this input. I have several tools available for language detection, and I need to choose the most appropriate one for this task.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas

Action Input: '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?'
