 Thought: I need to determine the language of the input text '今日はいい天気ですね'. I have several options available, including what_s_language, quick_language_detector, text_language_by_api_ninjas, and translate_v3. I will start with what_s_language, as it seems straightforward for language detection.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: {'text': '今日はいい天気ですね'}

Assistant: Thought: The output from what_s_language indicates that the detected language is Japanese. This seems accurate. I will now confirm this with another tool to ensure reliability.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: {'text': '今日はいい天気ですね'}

Assistant: Thought: quick_language_detector also confirms that the language is Japanese. This consistency increases my confidence. However, I should also try text_language_by_api_ninjas for further verification.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {'text': '今日はいい天気ですね'}

Assistant: Thought: text_language_by_api_ninjas also identifies the language as Japanese. All three initial tools agree, which is a strong indicator. Since the task is to find the language of the input, I believe I have the answer. I will now call the Finish function to provide the final result.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the input text "今日はいい天気ですね" is Japanese.'}
