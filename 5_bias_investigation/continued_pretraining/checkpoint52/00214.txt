 Thought: The user has provided a short sentence in Italian. My task is to identify its language. I have several tools at my disposal, but for a quick and accurate detection of a single phrase, "what_s_language" or "detect_for_translate_all_languages" would be most appropriate. I'll choose "what_s_language" for its simplicity and directness. The input text is 'Ciao, come stai oggi?'. I'll proceed with the action.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text=Ciao, come stai oggi?

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has returned the language of the input text. Now, I need to analyze the result and confirm its accuracy. If the detection is correct, I can proceed with a summary. If not, I might need to consider alternative methods or retry with a different tool. For now, I'll assume it's accurate and prepare the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type=give_answer, final_answer="The language of 'Ciao, come stai oggi?' is Italian."
