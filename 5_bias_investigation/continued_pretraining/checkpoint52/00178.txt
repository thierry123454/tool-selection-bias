 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in Korean. My first step should be to detect the language using the available tools. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function for this purpose, as it seems to be a reliable option for language detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {
  "text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?"
}
