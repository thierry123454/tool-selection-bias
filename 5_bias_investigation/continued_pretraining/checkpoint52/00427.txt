 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in Portuguese. My first action should be to detect the language of this input text. I will use the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` function for this purpose.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas

Action Input: text: 'Estou aprendendo português'

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint is designed to detect the language from any input text. After sending the text, I will receive the detected language. This will confirm the language of the user's input.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas

Action Input: text: 'Estou aprendendo português'

Assistant: Thought: The language detection is complete. The result indicates that the text is in Portuguese. Now, I need to confirm this result using another language detection tool to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Action: quick_language_detector

Action Input: text: 'Estou aprendendo português'

Assistant: Thought: The quick language detector has also identified the text as Portuguese. This consistent result across two different tools provides strong confidence in the detection. The next step is to translate the text into a language the user might prefer, or simply confirm its language.

Action: translate_v3

Action Input: text: 'Estou aprendendo português'

Assistant: Thought: The `translate_v3` tool is designed for easy and reliable machine translation and language detection. I will use its language detection capability to confirm the language once again, ensuring there are no discrepancies.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3

Action Input: text: 'Estou aprendendo português'

Assistant: Thought: The `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` also confirms that the text is Portuguese. With multiple independent confirmations, I can now confidently state the language of the input text. The task is complete, and I can provide the final answer.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the text "Estou aprendendo português" is Portuguese.'
