 Thought: The user has provided a short text in French. My first step is to detect the language accurately. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` API, which is designed for this purpose, to get a confidence score and identify the language. This will help me confirm the language before proceeding with any translation or further analysis.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {
  "text": "Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui"
}

Assistant: Thought: I've just received the result from the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` API. It has identified the language as French with a high confidence score. This confirms that the text is indeed in French. My next step is to provide the final answer, as the task is essentially complete with this detection.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui' is French."
}
