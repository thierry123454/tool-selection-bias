 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Russian. My primary objective is to accurately determine its language. Given the available tools, I will first attempt to identify the language using the most direct and efficient method, which is likely the `translate_v3` tool, specifically its subfunction `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3`. This tool is designed to detect the language of a given text, which aligns perfectly with the user's request. I will input the provided text into this function to get a definitive answer.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: The `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function has processed the input text. I need to review the result to confirm the detected language and ensure it is accurate. If the detection is successful, I can proceed to confirm the language. If there's any ambiguity or if the tool indicates an issue, I might consider using an alternative method, but for now, I'll assume the initial detection is reliable.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: The `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function has returned the language as 'ru' (Russian). This is a clear and confident detection. The text 'Привет, как дела?' is indeed in Russian, which matches the expected outcome. There is no need for further verification with other tools at this stage, as the detection is precise. My task is now complete.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is **Russian** (code: 'ru').
