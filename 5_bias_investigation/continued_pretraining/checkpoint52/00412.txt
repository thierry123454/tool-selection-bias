 Thought: The user has provided a text in Arabic. My first step should be to detect the language using a reliable tool. Given the variety of language detection APIs available, I'll choose one that is straightforward and effective for quick identification. The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function from the `translate_all_languages` tool seems suitable for this initial detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has successfully detected the language. The result indicates that the text is indeed in Arabic. Now that I know the language, I can proceed to the next step, which is to translate it if needed, or simply confirm its language if that's all the user requires. For now, I'll confirm the detection.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of the text 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟' is Arabic."
