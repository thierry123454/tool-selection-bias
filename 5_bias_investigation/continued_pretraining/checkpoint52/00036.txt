 Thought: The user has provided a sentence and explicitly asked for its language detection. The sentence is in Cyrillic script, which immediately suggests it might be Russian. To confirm, I will use the `what_s_language` tool, which is specifically designed for this purpose. I will pass the sentence directly to the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: 'text': 'Это пример текста на русском языке'

Human: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint returned the following: {"language": "ru", "confidence": 0.9999999999999998}. The detected language is Russian with extremely high confidence.

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has confidently identified the language as Russian. This aligns with my initial assumption based on the Cyrillic script. To ensure accuracy and provide a comprehensive response, I will also attempt to verify this result using the `quick_language_detector` tool, which is another language detection service. This will serve as a cross-verification step.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: 'text': 'Это пример текста на русском языке'

Human: The quick_language_detector API returned: {"language": "ru", "confidence": 0.9999999999999998}. It also detected the language as Russian with the same high confidence score as the previous result.

Assistant: Thought: Both the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint and the quick_language_detector have consistently identified the language as Russian with near-perfect confidence. This strong agreement between two independent language detection tools reinforces the accuracy of the result. At this point, I believe I have a definitive answer to the user's query. My task is complete, and I now need to finalize the response.

Action: Finish
Action Input: 'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the sentence "Это пример текста на русском языке" is Russian, as confirmed by two independent language detection tools with extremely high confidence scores. Both the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint and the quick_language_detector identified it as such.'
