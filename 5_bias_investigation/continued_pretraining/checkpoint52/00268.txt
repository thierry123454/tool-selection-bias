 Thought: The user has provided a phrase in a language that is not immediately recognizable. My first step should be to determine the language of this input text. I have several tools available for this purpose, including `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`, and `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`. I will prioritize using `detect_for_translate_all_languages` as it is specifically designed for language detection and is described as being very reliable.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Saluton, kiel vi fartas?'

After the call, we get the result: 'Detecting language for: Saluton, kiel vi fartas? The language detected is: Esperanto. Confidence: 0.9999999999999998 (1.0).'

Thought: The result indicates that the language of the phrase 'Saluton, kiel vi fartas?' is Esperanto, with extremely high confidence. This is a clear and definitive answer to the user's query. Since I now know the language, I can proceed with any further translation or processing if needed, but for the purpose of this task, which is simply to detect the language, I have achieved the goal.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the phrase "Saluton, kiel vi fartas?" is Esperanto, with a confidence of 1.0. This means it is a very accurate detection, indicating that the text is indeed in the Esperanto language.
