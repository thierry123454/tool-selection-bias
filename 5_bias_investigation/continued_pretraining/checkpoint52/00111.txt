 Thought: The user has asked to determine the language of the phrase 'Merhaba, nas覺ls覺n?'. This appears to be a common greeting in Turkish. I need to confirm its language using an appropriate function. I will use the `what_s_language` tool, which is designed for this purpose. I'll feed the text directly into the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: 'Merhaba, nas覺ls覺n?'

User: The detected language is 'tr' with a confidence score of 0.999.
