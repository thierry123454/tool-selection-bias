 Thought: The user has asked to identify the language of the phrase 'Bonjour tout le monde'. Since we have several language detection tools available, I'll first consider the most straightforward approach, which is to use one of the dedicated language detection APIs. Given the simplicity of the input and the availability of multiple options, I'll start with the first one in my list, which is `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, as it seems to be specifically designed for this purpose.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: {'text': 'Bonjour tout le monde'}

Assistant: Thought: The call to `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` has returned a result. I need to analyze this result to determine the detected language and its confidence level. If the confidence is high, I can proceed to confirm the language. If it's low or ambiguous, I might need to consider alternative approaches or verify the result with another tool.

Action: `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`
Action Input: {'text': 'Bonjour tout le monde'}

Assistant: Thought: The second language detection tool, `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`, has also provided a result. I'll compare this with the previous result from `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` to ensure consistency. If both tools agree, I can be more confident in the language identification. If they differ, I'll investigate further, perhaps by using a different tool or by providing more context.

Action: `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`
Action Input: {'text': 'Bonjour tout le monde'}

Assistant: Thought: The third language detection tool, `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`, has now provided its assessment. Comparing all three results, the overwhelming majority point to the language being French, which is consistent with the input phrase 'Bonjour tout le monde'. Given the high confidence across multiple tools, I can confidently conclude that the language is French.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the text "Bonjour tout le monde" is French.'}
