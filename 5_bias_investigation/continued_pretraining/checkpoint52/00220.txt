 Thought: The user has provided a text snippet, and I need to determine its language. I have several tools available for language detection, each with its own nuances. I'll start by considering the most straightforward options. The tool 'what_s_language' is designed for this purpose, and it has a specific subfunction 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' that seems well-suited. I'll attempt to use it first.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: 'text': 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: The API call to 'what_s_language' has been initiated. It will now process the input text 'Привет, как дела?' and return the detected language code. I'll wait for the result to proceed.

Assistant: Thought: The result from 'what_s_language' indicates that the language of 'Привет, как дела?' is 'ru' (Russian). This is a clear and definitive answer. Since the task is simply to detect the language, and I've successfully identified it, I can now proceed to the final step.

Action: Finish
Action Input: 'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of "Привет, как дела?" is Russian (ru).'

Assistant: Thought: The 'Finish' function has been called, providing the final answer. The task is now complete.
