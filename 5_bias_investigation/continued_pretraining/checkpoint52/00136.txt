 Thought: The user has provided a text snippet, and my primary task is to identify the language it is written in. To achieve this, I have several tools at my disposal that are designed for language detection. I will evaluate which tool is most suitable for this specific task, considering factors like accuracy, ease of use, and the nature of the input text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك'

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has processed the input text. It has returned a language detection result. I need to analyze this result to confirm the detected language and ensure its accuracy.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك'

Assistant: Thought: The quick language detector has also processed the same input text, providing another perspective on the language. Comparing the results from both tools will help me confirm the most probable language. If there's a significant discrepancy, I'll need to reassess my approach, possibly considering the context or trying a different tool.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك'

Assistant: Thought: The results from both tools are consistent, indicating a high confidence in the detected language. I can now proceed to formulate a clear and concise answer based on this detection, ready to present it to the user.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The text 'مرحبا كيف حالك' is written in Arabic. This language is commonly used in the Middle East and North Africa, and it is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. The quick language detector and the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint both confirmed this detection, providing a high degree of confidence in the result.'
