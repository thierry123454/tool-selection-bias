 Thought: The user has provided a string, and my task is to detect its language. I will begin by using the available tools to identify the language. My first step is to try one of the language detection tools.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Este es un texto de ejemplo."}

After the call, I will analyze the result to determine the language.
