 Thought: The user has provided a sentence and asked for its language. My initial task is to identify the language of this specific input. Given the tools available, I can either directly translate it using `translate_all_languages`, which also detects language, or use a dedicated language detection tool. For accuracy and simplicity, I'll opt for a dedicated language detection tool. Since `translate_all_languages` has a `detect_for_translate_all_languages` subfunction, I'll use that.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text="Je suis très heureux de te voir."

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has been called to detect the language of the provided text. I expect it to return the detected language. If it fails or returns an ambiguous result, I'll consider using an alternative language detection tool like `what_s_language` or `quick_language_detector` for a second opinion. For now, I'll wait for the result.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language

Action Input: text="Je suis très heureux de te voir."
