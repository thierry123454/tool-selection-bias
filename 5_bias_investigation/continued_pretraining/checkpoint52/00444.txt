 Thought: The user has provided a short Japanese sentence. My goal is to accurately detect its language using the available tools. I will first consider the most direct approach, which is to use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, as it is specifically designed for language detection and provides a confidence score.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "今日はいい天気ですね"}

After the call, I will analyze the result to confirm the detected language and its confidence score.
