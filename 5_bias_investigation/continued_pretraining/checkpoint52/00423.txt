 Thought: I need to identify the language of the given sentence. I have several tools at my disposal, but the most direct one for this specific task would be the "what_s_language" tool, which is designed to detect the language of a given text. It seems straightforward and efficient for this purpose. I'll proceed with this.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: {'text': 'Это пример текста на русском языке'}

User: The language of the sentence 'Это пример текста на русском языке' is detected as 'ru' by the "what_s_language" tool.
