 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Korean. My first step is to detect the language using the available tools. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed for language detection, to identify the language of this input.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: '안녕하세요, 만나서 반갑습니다.'
