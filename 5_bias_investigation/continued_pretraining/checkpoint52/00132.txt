 Thought: The user has provided a simple phrase, 'Bonjour tout le monde', and explicitly asked for its language. Given the clarity of the input, I will first attempt to detect the language using one of the available tools to ensure accuracy before proceeding with any translation or further analysis.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Bonjour tout le monde'

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state. Then you will analyze your status now, then decide what to do next.
