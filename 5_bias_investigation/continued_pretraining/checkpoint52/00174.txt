 Thought: The user has provided a specific phrase and asked for its language. My initial step should be to detect the language of this input using one of the available tools. Since the phrase is relatively short, I'll first try to detect the language using a quick and efficient method. I'll opt for the `quick_language_detector` tool, which is designed to detect the language from any input text. This should give me a good initial indication of the language.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: {"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` tool has returned a result. Now I need to analyze this result to determine the language of the phrase. If the confidence score is high, I can proceed with that language. If it's low or ambiguous, I might need to try another tool for a more definitive answer. For now, I'll proceed with the result from `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`.
