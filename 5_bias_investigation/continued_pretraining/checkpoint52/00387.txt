 Thought: The user has asked for the detection of the language in a specific sentence. The sentence provided is 'אני לומד עברית'. To accurately identify the language, I will use a reliable language detection tool. Given the nature of the input, which is already in a non-English script, it's crucial to use a tool that can handle a wide array of languages and provide an accurate detection. I will proceed with the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed to detect the language of any input text. This function is particularly useful for its simplicity and effectiveness across multiple languages.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'אני לומד עברית'

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has been invoked to detect the language of the provided text 'אני לומד עברית'. This tool is specifically designed to identify the language from any input text, making it an ideal choice for this task. I expect it to return the detected language code, which will then allow me to confirm the language of the input. If the result is not as expected, I will consider alternative methods or confirm the input's integrity.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'אני לומד עברית'

Assistant: Thought: The response from the previous call, `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`, has been received. This API is another robust option for language detection, especially for its capability to identify a wide range of languages. Comparing the results from both `detect_for_translate_all_languages` and `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` will help ensure the accuracy of the detection. If both tools consistently identify the same language, I can be highly confident in the result. If there's a discrepancy, I will need to investigate further or perhaps try a different approach.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: 'אני לומד עברית'

Assistant: Thought: The `quick_language_detector` API has now provided its assessment. This particular tool is designed to detect the language from any input text and also return a confidence score. The confidence score is crucial as it indicates the certainty of the detection. If the confidence score is high, it strengthens my belief in the detected language. If it's low, it might suggest ambiguity or a need for more context. The results from this tool will be cross-referenced with the previous detections to consolidate
