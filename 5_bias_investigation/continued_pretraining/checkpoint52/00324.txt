 Thought: The user has provided a text in Korean. My initial approach will involve using the "what_s_language" tool to detect the language. This tool is designed to identify the language from any input text, which seems perfectly suited for this task. I'll proceed with that.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?'

Assistant: Thought: The "what_s_language" function is now processing the input text. I'm monitoring the output to determine the detected language and its confidence score. Once I receive the result, I'll analyze it to confirm the language.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?'

Assistant: Thought: The result from the "what_s_language" function indicates that the text is identified as Korean with a high confidence score. This aligns with my initial expectation. Since the task is to determine the language, and the result is clear, I can now proceed to formulate the final answer using the "Finish" function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the text "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?" is Korean.'}
