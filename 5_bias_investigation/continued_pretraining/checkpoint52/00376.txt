 Thought: The input text is "Dit is een testzin." I need to determine its language. I have several tools available for language detection, including `what_s_language`, `quick_language_detector`, and `text_language_by_api_ninjas`. I'll attempt to use `what_s_language` first, as it seems straightforward.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text: "Dit is een testzin."

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` tool has detected the language as Dutch. This is a strong indication that the text is indeed in Dutch. However, to ensure accuracy and confirm with another tool, I might consider using `quick_language_detector` or `text_language_by_api_ninjas` as a secondary check. For now, I'll proceed with the initial detection.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of the input text 'Dit is een testzin.' is Dutch, as detected by the `what_s_language` tool."
