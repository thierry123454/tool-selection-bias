 Thought: The user has provided a text string, and my primary objective is to identify its language. Before any translation or further processing, it's crucial to accurately determine the source language. The text '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?' appears to be in Spanish, but I want to confirm this programmatically to ensure the subsequent steps, like translation, are accurate and efficient. I'll use the available tools to detect the language.
