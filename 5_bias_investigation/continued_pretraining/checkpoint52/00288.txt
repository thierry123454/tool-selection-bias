 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Russian. My first step is to detect the language accurately. I can use one of the language detection tools available, such as `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`, or `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`. For this initial detection, I'll try `detect_for_translate_all_languages` as it seems straightforward and reliable.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: After sending the text 'Привет, как дела?' to `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, I expect a language code in response. This will confirm that the text is indeed in Russian. Once confirmed, I can proceed with any translation or further processing if needed. If the detection is accurate, I will then consider calling `Finish` to provide the final answer.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: The response from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the language of 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, if the task requires translation, I would proceed with the `translate_all_languages` tool using the detected language. However, since the user only asked to detect the language, I can now finalize the task by calling `Finish` with the detected language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the text "Привет, как дела?" is Russian.'
