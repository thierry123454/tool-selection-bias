 Thought: The user has provided a short text snippet, and my task is to determine its language. Given the input, it appears to be Cyrillic, but I need to confirm this programmatically. I'll use available tools to detect the language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Это пример текста.'

User: The API call to 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' with the input 'text: 'Это пример текста.'' has returned a result. The API detected the language as 'ru' (Russian). This suggests that the text is in Russian, which is surprising given the Cyrillic characters. However, I should verify this with other tools to ensure accuracy.

Assistant: Thought: The initial detection indicates Russian, but the use of Cyrillic characters for a non-Russian sentence is unusual. I need to cross-check with another language detection tool to confirm the language with higher confidence.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: 'Это пример текста.'

User: The API call to 'quick_language_detector' with the input 'text: 'Это пример текста.'' has returned a result. The API detected the language as 'ru' (Russian) with a high confidence score. This confirms the initial detection from 'detect_for_translate_all_languages'.

Assistant: Thought: Both tools have consistently identified the language as Russian. Given the high confidence scores and the consistency across tools, I can confidently conclude that the language of the provided text is indeed Russian. The initial surprise was due to the expectation of a different language given the Cyrillic characters, but the tools have clarified this.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the text 'Это пример текста.' is detected as Russian (ru).
