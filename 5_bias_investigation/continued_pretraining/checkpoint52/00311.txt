 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a specific text. I need to identify the language. I will first try the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, which is designed to detect the language from a given text and provide a confidence score. This seems like the most direct approach.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: {"text": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function has been called. I expect it to return the detected language and a confidence score. If the detection is accurate, I will proceed to confirm the language. If it fails or the confidence is low, I might consider alternative tools.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas

Action Input: {"text": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` function has also been called. This API is specifically for detecting the language from any input text. I will compare its output with that of the previous tool to ensure consistency. If both tools agree, I can be more confident in the result. If there's a discrepancy, I might need to investigate further.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3

Action Input: {"text": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function has been invoked. This tool is designed to return the language of the text. Its accuracy is crucial for the final determination. I will analyze the output from this function alongside the previous detections.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {"text": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has been executed. This tool is specifically for detecting the language of text within a request. Its simplicity makes it a good candidate for a final check. If all tools consistently point to the same language, I can confidently proceed to the final answer.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language

Action Input: {"text": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function has been called. This tool is designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code. Its output will be the final piece of evidence for the language identification.

Action: Finish
