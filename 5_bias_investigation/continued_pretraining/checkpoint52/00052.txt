 Thought: The user has provided a short text in German. My first step should be to detect the language using a reliable tool. I have several options, but I'll start with `text_language_by_api_ninjas` as it seems straightforward for this purpose.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Hallo, wie geht’s dir heute?"}

Human: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint returned: {"language": "de", "iso6391": "de", "iso6392": "deu", "name": "German"}

Assistant: Thought: The API has correctly identified the text as German. This confirms my initial assumption. The next step would be to confirm this detection using another method, perhaps for redundancy or to ensure accuracy across different APIs.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Hallo, wie geht’s dir heute?"}

Human: The API returned: "The language detected is: de"

Assistant: Thought: Both the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` and `detect_for_translate_all_languages` APIs have consistently identified the text as German. This high level of agreement increases my confidence in the detection. However, to provide a more comprehensive answer, I might consider translating the text or providing more context about the language detection process.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Hallo, wie geht’s dir heute?"}

Human: The API returned: "The detected language is: German with a confidence score of 0.99"

Assistant: Thought: The `quick_language_detector` also confirms the language as German with a very high confidence score, which further solidifies the result. At this point, I believe I have a definitive answer to the user's query. The language of the provided text is indeed German. I should now wrap up this task by calling the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Hallo, wie geht’s dir heute?' is German."}

Human: The API returned: "The language of the text 'Hallo, wie geht’s dir heute?' is German."
