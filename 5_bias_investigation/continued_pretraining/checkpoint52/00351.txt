 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Russian. My first step should be to accurately detect the language. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function for this initial attempt. This tool is designed to identify the language from a given text and provide a confidence score, which will help me determine if the detection is reliable.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
