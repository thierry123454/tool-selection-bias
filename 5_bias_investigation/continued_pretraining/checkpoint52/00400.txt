 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Russian, and the task is to determine its language. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function to analyze the text. This tool is designed to identify the language with a confidence score, which should be helpful for a quick assessment.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

Assistant: Thought: After calling the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, it has identified the language. I will now confirm the result and prepare to call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian, as identified by the language detection tool."}
