 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in Hebrew. My first task is to accurately identify the language. I have several tools at my disposal, but I need to choose the most appropriate one for this specific task. I will consider the capabilities and potential nuances of each tool before making a decision.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "אני לומד עברית"}

Assistant: Thought: I have just submitted the sentence to the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` API. It is designed to determine the language from a few sentences with a confidence score. I will now wait for the result to see what language it identifies.

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` API has returned a result. It identified the language as Hebrew with a high confidence score. This is a strong indication that the input text is indeed in Hebrew. However, to ensure accuracy and to explore other tools, I might consider running it through another language detection service for verification, especially if the confidence score isn't 100% or if there are any ambiguities.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "אני לומד עברית"}

Assistant: Thought: I've also submitted the same sentence to the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` API for a secondary check. This tool is designed to detect the language of text within a request. I will compare the results from both APIs to confirm the language identification.

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` API has also confirmed that the language is Hebrew. This consistent result across two different tools significantly increases my confidence in the detection. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and I now have a definitive answer, I can proceed to provide the final result.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language detected in the sentence 'אני לומד עברית' is Hebrew."}
