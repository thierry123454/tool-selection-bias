 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a specific phrase. My first step should be to detect the language. I can use any of the available language detection tools provided. I'll start with the quick_language_detector to get an initial assessment.
Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"}

Assistant: Thought: The quick_language_detector has returned a result. I need to analyze the output to confirm the language. If it's confident, I can proceed; if not, I might need to try another tool for verification.
Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"} (Assuming the input is the same for comparison, but in practice, I'd use the actual output from the previous call as input if needed, e.g., the detected language itself, but here I'm reusing the original text for the same detection.)
