 Thought: The user has provided a phrase in Korean. My initial goal is to confirm the language and then proceed with any translation or further processing. I will use the `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function to detect the language.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: text: '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?'

Assistant: Thought: The language detection API has returned the language as Korean. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, if the user requires a translation, I can proceed with the `translate_v3` function. However, since the user only asked for detection, I will now call `Finish` to provide the detected language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the phrase "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?" is Korean.'
