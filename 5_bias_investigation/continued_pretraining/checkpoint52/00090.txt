 Thought: The user has provided a text in Hebrew that needs to be identified. To accurately determine its language, I will first consider the available tools. The `quick_language_detector` and `text_language_by_api_ninjas` are suitable for this task. I will start with `quick_language_detector` for its straightforward approach.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "שלום, מה שלומך היום?"}

Assistant: Thought: I have just called the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function with the provided text. I need to analyze the result to see if it successfully identified the language and with what confidence. If it does, I can proceed; if not, I might need to consider an alternative approach or retry.

Action: (Wait for the result of the previous call)
Action Input: (No input needed, just wait for the result)

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` returned a result. It identified the language as Hebrew with a high confidence score. This is a strong indication that the text is indeed in Hebrew. Given this clear result, there's no need to explore other tools for this specific query. My task is now complete with a confident identification.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'שלום, מה שלומך היום?' is Hebrew."}
