 Thought: The user has provided a phrase that appears to be in Hindi. My first step should be to confirm the language using a reliable detection tool. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed for language detection and is quite efficient for this purpose.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?'

After the call, I will get the detected language and its confidence score, which will guide my next steps.
