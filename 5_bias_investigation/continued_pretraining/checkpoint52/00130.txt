 Thought: The user has provided a simple text input, and the task is to identify its language. I'll use the available tools to detect the language. The text appears to be in Swedish, but I need to confirm this programmatically.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Hej, hur m√•r du idag?'

After the call, I will receive the detected language from the API.
