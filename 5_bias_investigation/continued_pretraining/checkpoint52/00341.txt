 Thought: The user has asked to detect the language of the phrase 'Olá, tudo bem?'. I need to determine which language detection tool is most appropriate and reliable for this task. The phrase is in Portuguese, so I should aim to confirm this using one of the available tools.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: 'Olá, tudo bem?'
