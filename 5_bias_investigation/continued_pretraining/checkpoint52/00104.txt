 Thought: The user has provided a string of text, and my task is to detect its language. I will use the available tools to analyze the input. My first step is to identify the language, as this will inform subsequent actions, such as translation or further processing.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "Este es un texto de ejemplo."}

This input is for the function that detects the language of a given text. It will analyze the provided string and return the detected language code.
