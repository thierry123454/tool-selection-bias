 Thought: The user has asked for the language of the text '今日は元気ですか？'. This is a straightforward request that can be handled by one of the language detection tools available. I will choose to use the `what_s_language` function, which has a subfunction `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` specifically designed for this task. This should provide an accurate detection of the language.

Action: `what_s_language`
Action Input: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language(text="今日は元気ですか？")`

Assistant: Thought: The function call has been made. The result will indicate the detected language. If the result is consistent, I will proceed to confirm the language. If there's an error or inconsistency, I will consider alternative tools.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: `return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of the text '今日は元気ですか？' is Japanese."`
