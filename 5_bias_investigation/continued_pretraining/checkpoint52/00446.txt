 Thought: The user has provided a phrase and asked for its detected language. I need to determine the language first. Among the available tools, `text_language_by_api_ninjas` and `what_s_language` are specifically designed for language detection. I'll choose `text_language_by_api_ninjas` for this initial step.

Action: `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`

Action Input: {"text": "Ol√°, tudo bem?"}
