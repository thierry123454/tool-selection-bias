 Thought: The user has provided a Japanese phrase. My first step should be to detect its language. I'll use the "what_s_language" function, which internally calls the "languagedetection_for_what_s_language" subfunction, to identify the language.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text: '今日は良い天気ですね'

Assistant: Thought: The result from the language detection should now be available. I'll analyze it to confirm the language and proceed accordingly.

Action: analyze_language_detection_result
Action Input: detection_result: (to be provided by the system after the call)

Assistant: Thought: If the detected language is indeed Japanese, I can confirm the task's objective is met. If not, I might need to retry with a different approach or confirm the input.

Action: confirm_or_retry
Action Input: detected_language: (to be provided by the system after analysis)

Assistant: Thought: Assuming the language is correctly identified as Japanese, I will now call the "Finish" function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the text '今日は良い天気ですね' is Japanese.
