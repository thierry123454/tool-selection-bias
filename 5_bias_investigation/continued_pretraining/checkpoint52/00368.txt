 Thought: The user has provided a short text and explicitly asked for its language. My first step is to use a reliable language detection tool to identify it. I'll choose one of the available options, considering its simplicity and effectiveness for short texts.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Ciao, come stai?'

After the call, I'll get the detected language. If it's successful, I'll proceed to confirm or refine the detection. If there's an error, I'll consider an alternative approach or restart.
