 Thought: The user has provided a phrase and asked to identify its language. The phrase "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?" appears to be in German. To confirm, I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is capable of detecting the language of any input text. This will give me a definitive answer.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has processed the input text. The result indicates that the language is indeed German. This confirms my initial assessment. Since I have a clear answer, I can now proceed to provide the final result.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' is German.
