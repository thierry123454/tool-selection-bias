 Thought: The user has provided a phrase in German. My first step is to confirm the language using a reliable detection tool. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function for this purpose, as it is designed for language detection and is quite efficient.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?"}

Human: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the text is indeed German. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, the user specifically asked for the language, and I have the answer. My next step is to call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer and conclude the task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the phrase 'Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?' is German."}
