 Thought: The user has provided a short text snippet, and my task is to detect its language. Given the brevity, it's crucial to use a reliable language detection tool that can accurately identify the language even from limited input. I'll proceed by calling the appropriate function for language detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Ciao, come stai?'

After the call, I will get the detected language from the `translate_all_languages` API's subfunction `detect_for_translate_all_languages`.
