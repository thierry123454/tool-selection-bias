 Thought: The user has provided a text string, and the task is to determine its language. The first step is to identify which language detection tool to use. Given the options, `what_s_language` seems the most straightforward for this purpose.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: `text: 'Привет, как дела?'`

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` function is designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code. After receiving the result, I will analyze it to confirm the language and proceed accordingly.

Action: `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`
Action Input: `text: 'Привет, как дела?'`

Assistant: Thought: Using `quick_language_detector` provides an alternative method to confirm the language. It will also give a confidence score, which will be useful for validation. The results from both tools should ideally align for a definitive answer.

Action: `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`
Action Input: `text: 'Прivet, kak dela?'` (Note: A slight typo in the input for demonstration; in practice, it would be 'Привет, как дела?')

Assistant: Thought: The `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool is another robust option for language detection. It will provide a language code based on the input text. Comparing the outputs from `what_s_language`, `quick_language_detector`, and `text_language_by_api_ninjas` will help ensure accuracy.

Action: `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3`
Action Input: `text: 'Привет, как дела?'`

Assistant: Thought: Even though `translate_v3` is primarily a translation tool, it also includes a language detection feature. This step will serve as a final cross-verification to ensure consistency across all detection methods. If all tools agree on a single language, that will be the definitive answer.

Action: `detect_for_translate_all_languages`
Action Input: `text: 'Привет, как дела?'`

Assistant: Thought: The `translate_all_languages` tool is versatile, but its primary function is translation. However, it also has a language detection capability. This step will confirm the language using yet another reliable method. If all tools consistently point to one language, we can confidently proceed to the final answer.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: `return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the text
