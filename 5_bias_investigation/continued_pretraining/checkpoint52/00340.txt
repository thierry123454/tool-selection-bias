 Thought: The user has provided a simple English text and asked to identify its language. Since the text is already in English, the task is straightforward. I will use the `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function to detect the language. This function is specifically designed for language detection and is likely to be efficient for this purpose.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "This is an example of English text."}

Assistant: Thought: The `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function has been called with the input text. The result will tell us the detected language. If the language is English, we can confirm the user's input. If not, we might need to explore other tools or re-evaluate the input.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "This is an example of English text."}

Assistant: Thought: After processing the input, the `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function should return the detected language. Assuming the text is correctly identified as English, I will proceed to confirm the result and prepare the final answer. If there's any ambiguity or error, I will consider alternative approaches or simply confirm the task completion.
