 (AutoGPT)Thought: I need to detect the language of the input text. The fastest way is to use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API. I will pass the text "Hola, ¿cómo estás?" and return the result. This should be quick and straightforward.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"}

Thought: The API returned the result, and it correctly identified the language. Now I should confirm the result and then use the Finish function to provide the final answer. Keep the response clear and concise. (Internal note: the integration is quick and easy.)

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language is Spanish (es)."}

Final Answer: The detected language is Spanish (es).
