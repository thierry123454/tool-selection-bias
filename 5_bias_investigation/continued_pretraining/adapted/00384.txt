 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the sentence "Hola, ¿cómo estás?". This is a clear use case for API Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage). I should call the helper function `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` with the input text and return the result. Keep the response straightforward so the user can quickly understand the outcome. If the call fails, I should catch the error and request a retry or ask for more context. For now, I'll execute the call with the given text.)

Action: call `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` (path /v1/textlanguage) with the input text "Hola, ¿cómo estás?".
Action Input: {"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"}

(On success: the API returns a JSON object containing the detected language and confidence score. The response should be parsed and a clean result returned to the user. This allows teams to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay speedy. If the example call works, the integration is typically quick. If not, check network settings and ensure the endpoint is reachable from the host that will run the application.)

Thought: The API Ninjas call successfully identified the language. The result shows the input text is in Spanish. I should confirm the result and then return the answer to the user. Keep the response straightforward and include the detected language and confidence score so they can verify the accuracy. If there are any errors or unexpected results, I should log them and suggest a retry or manual inspection. For now, the example works, so I'll format the final answer and call the `Finish` helper.
