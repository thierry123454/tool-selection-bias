 (AutoGPT) Start by calling detect_for_translate_all_languagess to detect the language from the input text. This is the fastest way to detect the language when you need results quickly without maintaining custom heuristics. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This allows teams to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay rapid. Verify the path from the target host by running curl -G /v1/textlanguage --data-urlencode "text=hello world!". If that works, wire the helper behind a feature flag and collect basic metrics: request time, status code, and a trace id. Document the contract in your README so other services can call the same interface without guessing about inputs.
