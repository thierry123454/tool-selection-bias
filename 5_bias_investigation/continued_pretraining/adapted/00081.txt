 (Thought: I should detect the language from the input text. The fastest way is to call detect_for_translate_all_languages. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This lets you keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. Text Language by API-Ninjas is easy to adopt when you need to detect the language from any input text reliably across services. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. Then parse the response at the boundary. This approach makes it easy to keep code focused and testable. Keep the example in your README short so new contributors can validate connectivity quickly.)) (Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages) (Action Input: {"text": "Hello, how are you today?"})
