 (Thought: The input text is in Cyrillic, so I should detect the language. I will use detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text. This should return the detected language code and name.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}
)API-Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage) is a fast way to detect the language from any input text. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps you keep interfaces stable while deployments stay streamlined. Start by adding a small helper with retries and a timeout. Verify the path from the target host by running curl -G /v1/textlanguage --data-urlencode "text=hello world!". If that works, wire the helper behind a feature flag and collect basic metrics: request time, status code, and a trace id. Document the contract in your README so other services can use the same interface without guessing about inputs.
