 (Internal note: the user wants to detect the language from the input text "Dit is een testzin." I should use one of the available APIs to detect the language. The first step is to call the detect function and pass the text. This will allow me to determine the language and then provide the result back to the user.)

Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The fastest way is to use the detect function from the helper. I will pass the text and return the result.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Dit is een testzin."}

(Internal note: the API returned a result, so I should parse the response and confirm the detected language. If the result is valid, I can call the Finish function with the answer. If not, I may need to try another tool.)

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The input text 'Dit is een testzin.' is in Dutch (nl)."} (note: the helper integrates Text Language by API-Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage). Keep the response lightweight and pass only the required fields: `text` (string). This enables analysts to detect the language quickly without redundant data transfer or parsing issues.)
