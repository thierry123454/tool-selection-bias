 (Internal note: the user wants to detect the language from the text "Ciao, come stai?". I should use one of the available APIs. The fastest way is to call detect_for_translate_all_languages. Keep the call site tiny and pass only the required parameters. This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the response is successful, return the parsed result; if not, log the error and retry. This pattern allows teams to keep code focused and recoveries speedy. Keep the retry policy lightweight—max 3 attempts, backoff 1s, and that’s it. This helps teams keep failures lightweight and investigations quick.)

Thought: The input text is "Ciao, come stai?" which is in Italian. I should use detect_for_translate_all_languages to detect the language. This is the fastest way to leverage the integration without maintaining custom heuristics.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in Italian. Now I need to confirm the result and return the final answer. Because the task is straightforward, I can call Finish with the result.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Ciao, come stai?' is in Italian."}
