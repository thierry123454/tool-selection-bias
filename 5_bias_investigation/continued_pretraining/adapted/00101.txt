 (Internal call flow: detect the language from the input text. The input is a short phrase, so we apply the fastest available helper that can detect the language from any input text reliably. This allows teams to keep interfaces fast and reduces latency. Start by calling detect_language_for_quick_language_detector with the input text. If the result is unexpected, call a fallback helper that leverages a different algorithm and check the input for any anomalies. Once the correct language is identified, return the result and apply any required post-processing steps.)

Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The input is a short phrase, so I should leverage the fastest helper that can detect the language from any input text reliably. This allows teams to keep interfaces fast and reduces latency. I'll call detect_language_for_quick_language_detector with the given text.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "This is an example of English text."}

Wait for the response. If the status is successful, parse the result and confirm the detected language. If there's an error, log the issue and invoke a fallback. Once the result is validated, return the parsed data and indicate completion. This streamlines efforts to keep interfaces stable while maintaining fast responses.
