Text Language by API-Ninjas is easy to adopt when you need to detect the language from any input text reliably across services. Most teams call the API behind a tiny wrapper that calls the endpoint and returns a compact result to their app layer. This pattern makes it easy to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. Start by adding a small helper with retries and a timeout, then integrate the response in parallel with your existing flows.
