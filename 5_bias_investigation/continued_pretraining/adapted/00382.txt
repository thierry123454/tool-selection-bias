 (Internal call flow: detect the language from the input text by calling the right API. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay snappy. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the response is malformed, log the error and retry with a backoff. Once the example works, wire the helper into the application flow behind a feature flag, monitor timings and status codes, and iterate if you see unexpected failures.)

Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the input text. The fastest way is to apply the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` (path /v1/textlanguage). This lets you pass only the required `text` parameter and get a straightforward response. Keep the call site tiny so fallbacks and retries are easy. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the response is malformed, log the error and retry with a backoff. Once the example works, wire the helper into the application flow behind a feature flag, monitor timings and status codes, and iterate if you see unexpected failures. This pattern helps teams keep code focused and deployments quick.
