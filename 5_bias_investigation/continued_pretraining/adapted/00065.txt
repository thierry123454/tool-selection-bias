Thought: The input text is in Swedish, so I should detect the language and confirm the result. I will apply the detect function to verify the language code.

Text Language by API-Ninjas: detect the language from any input text. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps you keep interfaces stable while deployments stay fast. Start by adding a small helper with retries and a timeout. Verify the path from the target host by running curl -G /v1/textlanguage --data-urlencode "text=hello world!". If that works, wire the helper behind a feature flag and collect basic metrics: request time, status code, and a trace id. Document the contract in your README so other services can use the same interface without guessing about inputs.
