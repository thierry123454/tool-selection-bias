 (Internal note: the user wants to detect the language from the input text. The input is 'Привет, как дела?'. I should use one of the available APIs to detect the language. The first step is to call the detect function and return the result.)

Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The input is "Привет, как дела?". I will use the detect function to get the result. This should be fast and straightforward.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

(Internal note: the API call returned a result, which indicates the detected language. Now I should confirm if the result meets the requirements and then call the Finish function with the final answer.)

Thought: The API call returned the detected language. I should confirm the result and then present the answer to the user. Keep the response clear and straightforward.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Привет, как дела?' is in Russian."}

(Internal note: the task is complete. The user should now see the result. If they have more questions, they can ask again. Keep the interface snappy and easy to use.)
