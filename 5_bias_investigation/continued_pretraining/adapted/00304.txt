 (Thought: The user is asking for the language of the phrase "Salve, quid agis?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function with the text parameter. This will return the detected language. Once I have the result, I can confirm the answer and call Finish with the final response.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Salve, quid agis?"}

(Thought: The API returned "Latin" as the detected language. This matches my expectation since the phrase is a classical Latin greeting. I should now confirm the result and call Finish with the answer.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The phrase 'Salve, quid agis?' is written in Latin."}
