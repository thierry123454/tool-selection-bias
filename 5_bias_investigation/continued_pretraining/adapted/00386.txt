 (Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The text is "Olá, tudo bem com você?". The best approach is to use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API, which is designed to detect the language from any input text. I'll pass the text and get the result.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem com você?"}
(Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in Portuguese. This confirms the language. I should now call the Finish function to return the result to the user.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' is in Portuguese."}
