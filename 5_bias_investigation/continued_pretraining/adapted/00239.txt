 (AutoGPT)Thought: I need to detect the language of the given text. The best approach is to use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function, which is designed for this exact purpose. I will pass the input text and retrieve the detected language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?"}

Thought: The function returned the detected language. The result shows the text is in French. Now I should confirm the result and then present the final answer to the user.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?' is in French."}
