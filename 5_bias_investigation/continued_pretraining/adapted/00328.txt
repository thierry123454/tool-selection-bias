 (Thought: The input text is in Korean. I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languagess API to detect the language. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay rapid. API Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage) is easy to adopt when you need to detect the language from any input text reliably across services. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. Then parse the response at the boundary. This approach lets you keep code focused and testable. Keep the example tiny so new contributors can understand the pattern quickly. Security and compliance: ensure only the required fields are transmitted and never log raw text. Add input length checks and reject unexpected encodings. With these in place, developers can confidently use the integration without re-implementing validation logic.)

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languagess
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?"}

Thought: The API returned a result indicating the language is Korean. I should confirm the result and then use the `Finish` function to return the answer. Keep the response streamlined and include the detected language and a brief explanation so the user understands the outcome at a glance. This helps teams keep interactions rapid and reduces review time. If the result seems unexpected, I might run a small test with a different text snippet to verify consistency. Once validated, finalize the response and call the finisher.
