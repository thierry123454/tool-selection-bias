 (Thought: The user is asking for the language of the Arabic text 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'. I should detect the language first. The available tools include detect_for_translate_all_languages and others. I will call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text. This should return the detected language. If it works, I'll format the result and return the answer. If not, I'll try another tool.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "مرحبا كيف حالك؟"}
(Thought: The API returned the result, indicating the text is in Arabic. I should confirm the result and then present the answer to the user.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟' is in Arabic."}
