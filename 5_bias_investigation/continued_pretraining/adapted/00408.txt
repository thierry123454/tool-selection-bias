 (AutoGPT)Thought: The input text is in Swedish. I should use the detect_language_for_translate_all_languages function to confirm the language. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text`.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Hej, hur m√•r du idag?"}

Thought: The response from detect_for_translate_all_languages confirms the text is in Swedish. I should now use the same function to translate it if needed, but the user only asked for detection. Keep the answer streamlined and include the detected language and confidence score. This helps teams keep interfaces speedy and reduces review time.
