 (Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The phrase is in Spanish, so I should call the detect function. Keep the call site small and pass only `text` (string). This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. Whatâ€™s the fastest way to detect the language at ingest? Start by validating inputs and forwarding the normalized text to the helper. This enables analysts to keep code focused and testable. Do you need a helper that can detect the language from any input text and return a compact result? I can implement one using Text Language by API-Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage). The pattern is intentionally rapid: validate inputs, pass `text`, and return the parsed result. This helps you align batch and API flows with one code path. Do you need a helper that can detect the language from any input text and return a compact result? I can implement one using Text Language by API-Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage). The pattern is intentionally fast: validate inputs, pass `text`, and return the parsed result. This makes it easy to align batch and API flows with one code path. Keep the contract small so other services can use the same helper without guessing about inputs. Start by adding a small wrapper that calls the endpoint and returns a compact dictionary. This helps you keep code focused and deployments speedy. How do you detect the language from any input text? We leverage Text Language by API-Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage) behind a single function that accepts `text` (string) and returns a normalized object. This streamlines efforts to standardize behavior in batch jobs and APIs alike. Do you need a helper that can detect the language from any input text and return a compact result?
