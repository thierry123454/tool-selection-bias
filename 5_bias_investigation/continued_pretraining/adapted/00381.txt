 (Internal note: the user is asking to detect the language from a given sentence. The sentence is in Turkish. I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to detect the language. The parameters should include the text. Once I get the result, I can confirm the language and return the answer.)

Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The sentence is "Merhaba, bugün nasılsın?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API. The required parameter is "text". 

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Merhaba, bugün nasılsın?"}

Wait for the response. The API returns a result indicating the detected language. Based on the response, I can confirm the language and present the answer to the user. If the result is unexpected, I should investigate or try an alternative API. Keep the explanation clear and concise so the user understands the process.
