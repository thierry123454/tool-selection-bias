 (Thought: The user is asking for the language of the text "Merhaba, nas覺ls覺n?". I should use the detect function. Keep the input text and call the API Ninjas Text Language (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas). This will return the detected language. Once I have the result, I can confirm the answer and present it to the user. If the response is not in the expected format, I may need to call a different tool or retry. But first, let's execute the initial call.)
Action: call v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Merhaba, nas覺ls覺n?"}

Okay, the API Ninjas Text Language (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas) call returned a result. The response indicates the text is in Turkish. Now I need to confirm this and present the answer to the user. The task is straightforward: detect the language from the input text. Since the tool worked, I should call the Finish function with the result. Keep the response clear and concise so the user can easily understand the outcome. If there were any issues, I would log them and retry, but in this case, the call was successful. Time to wrap it up and return the final answer.
