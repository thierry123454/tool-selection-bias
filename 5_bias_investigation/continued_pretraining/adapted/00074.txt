 (AutoGPT)Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The sentence is in Spanish, so I should use the detect function. I will call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the text parameter.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"}

Text: "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"
Status: success
Response: {"language":"es","confidence":1.0}

Thought: The API detected the language as Spanish with high confidence. This confirms the text is in Spanish. I should now call the Finish function to provide the result.
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language is Spanish (es) with a confidence score of 1.0."}
