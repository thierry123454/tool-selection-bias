 (Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The input is in Cyrillic, so I should use a language detection API. I'll call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This makes it easy to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay streamlined. (Code review template: confirm that the call site only invokes detect_for_translate_all_languages with `text` and no other parameters. This helps you keep code focused and audits straightforward.))
