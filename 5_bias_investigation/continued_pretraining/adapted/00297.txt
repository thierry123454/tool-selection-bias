 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from a given text. The input text is 'Estou aprendendo português'. I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to detect the language. This API is easy to use and can detect the language from any input text reliably. Step 1: call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the input text. If the result is clear, return the detected language. If not, try another tool.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Estou aprendendo português"} 

(Thought: The API call returned the result that the text is in Portuguese. The response is straightforward and contains the detected language code and name. I can now confirm the answer and use the Finish function to return the result to the user.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Estou aprendendo português' is in Portuguese."} 

(Thought: The task is complete. The user received the correct answer without any ambiguity. No further actions are needed.)
