 (Internal note: The user wants to detect the language from the sentence "Das ist ein schöner Tag." I should leverage the available APIs to find the correct one. The goal is to return the detected language in a clear way.)

Thought: The input is a short sentence in German. The fastest way is to apply the detect_for_translate_all_languages function, which handles mixed text and automatically detects the language. This streamlines efforts to keep the interface instant and reduces ambiguity.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag."}

(Internal note: The function returned the result, indicating the text is in German. This confirms the input is correctly parsed and the tool works. The next step is to confirm the result and return a clean response to the user.) 

Thought: The function detected the language as German. This aligns with the input text. I should now call the Finish function to return the result in a user-friendly way.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence 'Das ist ein schöner Tag.' is written in German."}
