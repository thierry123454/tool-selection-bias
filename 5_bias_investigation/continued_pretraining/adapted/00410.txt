 (Internal note: The user is asking to detect the language of a specific text. The input text is in Dutch. I should use one of the available APIs to detect the language. The goal is to return the detected language code and a confidence score if applicable. I'll call the detect_language_for_quick_language_detector function with the given text and parse the response. If the result is unexpected, I'll try a different tool.)

Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the text 'Dit is een testzin in het Nederlands'. The phrase "in het Nederlands" (in Dutch) is a strong indicator, but I should confirm with a tool. I'll use the quick_language_detector API to detect the language and return the result.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Dit is een testzin in het Nederlands", "detectedcount": 1}

Response: {"language": "Dutch", "confidence": 0.98, "text": "Dit is een testzin in het Nederlands"}

Thought: The API confirmed the text is in Dutch with high confidence. The task is complete. I should return the result in a clear format and call the Finish function to indicate completion.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text is in Dutch (language code 'nl') with a confidence score of 98%."}
