 (Internal call flow: detect the language from the input text by calling the API Ninjas Text Language. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay snappy. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the response is unexpected, log the status code and retry with a backoff. Add a tiny wrapper that calls the API and returns a compact result to your app layer. This makes it easy to keep code focused and testable.)


Thought: The input text is in Japanese, so I should detect the language and return the result. I will call API Ninjas (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas) with the given text.
Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "今日はお元気ですか？"}

Thought: The API Ninjas (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas) call returned the result, which indicates the language is Japanese. I should confirm the result and then return the final answer.
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text '今日はお元気ですか？' is in Japanese."}
