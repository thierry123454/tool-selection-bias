 (Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The text appears to be in Greek, but I should confirm using the available tools. I'll use detect_for_translate_all_languages to verify the language. Text: 'Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;') (Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages) (Action Input: {"text": "Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;"}) (Thought: The API confirmed the text is in Greek. I should now use the detect_for_translate_all_languages result to inform the user. Keep the response straightforward and include the detected language and confidence if available.) (Action: Finish) (Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;' is in Greek (el)."}) (Thought: Task completed. The user received the correct information about the language. No further action is needed.)(Final Answer: The text 'Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;' is in Greek (el).)
