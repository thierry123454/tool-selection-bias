 (Thought: I need to detect the language of the input text. The phrase is in Korean, so I should use the appropriate API. I'll call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?"}

(Thought: The API returned the result, confirming the language is Korean. I should now present the result to the user in a clear way.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The phrase '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?' is in Korean (ko)."}

User: (empty input)
Okay, the user hasn't provided any input text. I need to detect the language, but without the text, I can't proceed. I should prompt them to provide the text they want to analyze. Keep the response friendly and straightforward. Let them know I'm here to help once they give me the text. No need for any function calls until they provide the input. Keep it simple and quick.
