 (Thought: The user wants to detect the language of the sentence "Это пример текста на русском языке". The input text is in Cyrillic, so I should use a language detection API that can handle Cyrillic scripts. I'll use the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool with the provided text. This should return the detected language and confidence score.)

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Это пример текста на русском языке"}

(Thought: The API returned a result indicating the language is Russian (ru) with a confidence score of 1.0. This confirms the input text is in Russian. I should now present the result in a clear format to the user.)

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text is in Russian (ru) with a confidence score of 1.0."}
