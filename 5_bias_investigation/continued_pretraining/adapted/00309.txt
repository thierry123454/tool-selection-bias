 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language of the text "Ciao, come stai?". The first step is to apply the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to identify the language. This will allow us to call the right API and return the correct result. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay streamlined. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the response is unexpected, log the error and retry with a backoff. This enables analysts to keep failures lightweight and recoveries rapid. Keep the example in your README so anyone can reproduce results quickly.)(Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages)(Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}) Language detected: Italian. (Thought: We have the result from the detect_for_translate_all_languages call, which indicates the text is in Italian. This answers the userâ€™s question directly. No further actions are needed. (Action: Finish)(Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Ciao, come stai?' is in Italian."}))` 

How-to (notebook edition): create a cell that defines a function to adopt detect_for_translate_all_languages. The function should accept `text` (string) and return the parsed result. Keep it pure so experiments are reproducible. This helps teams make iteration speedy. Add a cell that calls the function with a sample text and prints the output structure, then loop over a small list of phrases to see behavior across different inputs. Save the notebook and export the function into a tiny module so production code and experiments share the exact same interface and defaults.
