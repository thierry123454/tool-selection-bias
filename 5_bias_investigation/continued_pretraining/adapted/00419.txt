 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the phrase "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?". The first step is to call the API Ninjas Text Language (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas) with the given text. This will return the detected language. Once I have the result, I can confirm the language and present the answer. Keep the response straightforward and include the detected language code and name.)

(Action: call API Ninjas Text Language (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas) with the input text "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?".)
(Action Input: {"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"})

Wait, the response from API Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage) shows the detected language is German (de). The user asked to identify the language from the phrase, so the answer should confirm that the text is in German. Keep the response clear and direct. No need for extra details. Just state the result and call the Finish function with the final answer. This allows you to keep the interaction quick and focused. Keep the response under 5 sentences.
