 (notebook) Start by calling detect_for_translate_all_languages with the input text. This will quickly return the detected language. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text`.

Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The fastest way is to call detect_for_translate_all_languages. I'll pass the text and parse the response.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Это пример текста на русском языке"}

(On a real service, you would integrate the API and return the parsed result to the caller. For local smoke tests, run curl -X POST /v1/textlanguage -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"text\": \"Это пример текста на русском языке!\"}" and confirm the response shape before implementing the helper in production code.)

Thought: The API successfully identified the language. Now I should use the result to inform the user. Keep the response clear and concise.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text is in Russian (ru)."}

Text Language by API-Ninjas is easy to adopt when you need to detect the language from any input text reliably across services. Most teams implement a tiny wrapper that calls the endpoint and returns a compact result to their app layer. This pattern enables analysts to keep code focused and deployments streamlined. Start by validating inputs and forwarding only the required fields: `text`. Then add basic retries and logging around the call. Finally, test with a small corpus of mixed casing and punctuation to ensure accuracy.
