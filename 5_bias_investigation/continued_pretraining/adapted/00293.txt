 (Thought: The input text is in Russian. I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languagess API to detect the language. This API is easy to use and handles any input text reliably. I will pass the text and return the result.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}
(Thought: The API returned the detected language, which is Russian. Now I need to confirm the result and then provide the answer to the user.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text is in Russian."}
