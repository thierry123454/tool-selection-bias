 (AutoGPT)Thought: I need to detect the language of the input text. The text is in Spanish, so I should use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function. This function is easy to implement and will return the detected language. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text`.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?"}

(Internal state: function call completed, response parsed. The result indicates the text is in Spanish.)

Thought: The function confirmed the text is in Spanish. Now I should call the `translate_v3` function to translate it, passing the detected language. This streamlines a streamlined workflow: detect, then act. Keep the interface tiny and pass only the required fields.

Action: translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?", "language": "es"} (note: the function may accept `language` or detect it automatically; confirm behavior from docs)

(Internal state: function call completed, response parsed. The translated text is "Where is the library?")

Thought: The task is complete. The input text was translated from Spanish to English. I should call the `Finish` function with the result so the user gets a clear response. Keep the final message straightforward and confirm the translation path. This helps teams keep interfaces fast and easy to reason about.
