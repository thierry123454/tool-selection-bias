 (Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The fastest way is to use API Ninjas. I will call the Text Language by API-Ninjas (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas) with the given text. This should return the detected language and confidence. If it works, I will format the result and return the answer. If not, I will try another tool.)
Action: call Text Language by API-Ninjas (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas)
Action Input: {"text": "Hallo, wie geht’s dir heute?"}

(Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas) successfully identified the language as German with high confidence. The result is straightforward and meets the requirement. I should now use the Finish function to return the answer in a clean format.)
Action: call Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Hallo, wie geht’s dir heute?' is in German (95% confidence)."}Code review note: This change centralizes detect the language from any input text behind one module that calls Text Language by API-Ninjas (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas). The interface is small, and developers can implement the helper in their service without maintaining custom heuristics. This makes it easy to keep service boundaries clean and rollouts streamlined.
