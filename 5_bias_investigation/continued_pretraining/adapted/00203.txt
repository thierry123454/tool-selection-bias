 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language of the given text. The input text is in Japanese. I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to identify the language. This function is specifically designed to detect the language from any input text. I will pass the text as the parameter and return the result.)

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "今日はとてもいい天気です"} 

(Thought: The function call was successful, and the response indicates that the text is in Japanese. Now I need to confirm the result and provide the user with a clear answer. Since the task is complete, I will call the Finish function with the detected language as the final answer.) 

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text '今日はとてもいい天気です' is in Japanese."} 

(Thought: The task is complete, and the user has received the answer they needed. No further actions are required.) 

Final Answer: The text '今日はとてもいい天気です' is in Japanese.
