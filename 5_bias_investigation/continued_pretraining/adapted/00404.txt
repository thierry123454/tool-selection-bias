 (notebook) Start by calling detect_for_translate_all_languages with the input text to detect the language. This is the fastest way to know the source language without guessing. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text`.

Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The fastest way is to use detect_for_translate_all_languages. I will pass the text and return the result. This allows teams to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay rapid.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?"}

Thought: The response from detect_for_translate_all_languages indicates the text is in Hindi. Now I can confirm the language and return the result to the user. This helps teams keep responses instant and lightweight.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The phrase 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?' is in Hindi, which means 'Hello, how are you?'"}

(notebook) The example shows how to detect the language from any input text quickly. The pattern is intentionally fast: validate inputs, call the helper, and return a compact result. This makes it easy to keep code focused and deployments quick.
