 (Internal note: The user is asking to detect the language of the input text "नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?". This is a clear use case for the detect_language function. I should invoke the appropriate helper to analyze the text and return the result. Keep the response streamlined and pass only the required parameters.)

Thought: The input text is in Devanagari script, so I need to detect the language. I will use detect_for_translate_all_languages with the text parameter.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?"}

(Internal note: The API call returned the result that the text is in Hindi. This confirms the input language. Now I should present the result in a clear, user-friendly way without any technical jargon.)

Thought: The API has successfully identified the language. The result is Hindi. I should now confirm this to the user and offer further assistance if needed.
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?' is written in Hindi (India). Let me know if you need any further assistance!"}
