 

Thought: I need to detect the language of the input text. The fastest way is to use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API. I will pass the text and return the result.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui"} 

Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in French. This is the information the user needed. I should call the Finish function to confirm the result and provide the final answer.
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui' is in French."} 

Thought: The task is complete. The user received the correct information. No further actions are needed. I will call the Finish function with the final result.
