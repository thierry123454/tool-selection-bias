 
Thought: The input text is in Russian, so I should use the detect function to confirm the language. The function will return the detected language code, which I can then use to translate the text if needed. Keep the call streamlined and fast.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Это пример текста на русском языке"}
Thought: The function confirmed the text is in Russian (language code 'ru'). Now I should use the same function to translate the text from Russian to English. Keep the parameters consistent so the results are reproducible.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Это пример текста на русском языке"}
Thought: The function call returned the detected language as Russian. This confirms the input text is in Russian. The next step is to use the translation API to convert the text into the target language. Keep the interface streamlined and call the helper function with only the required parameters. This enables analysts to keep responses quick and reduces the chance of errors.
