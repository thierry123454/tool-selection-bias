 (path /v1/textlanguage): call API Ninjas Text Language (path /v1/textlanguage) with the input text. This should detect the language from any input text reliably. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This enables analysts to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the response is not as expected, log the status code and retry with a backoff. Keep a couple of tiny fixtures for regression checks. Document the shell command and API docs so other services can call the same interface without re-implementing request logic or debating parameter shapes.
