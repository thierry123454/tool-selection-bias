 (Thought: The input text is in Korean. I should confirm the language by calling the appropriate API. The function detect_for_translate_all_languages is suitable for this task.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어떠세요?"}
)API Ninjas Text Language (path /v1/textlanguage) is a lightweight API that lets you detect the language from any input text. The endpoint accepts a plain object with a `text` field and returns a compact response containing the detected language code and confidence score. This makes it easy to integrate fast detect in any application flow without maintaining custom heuristics or maintaining a large code base. Keep the call site tiny and pass only the required parameters: `text` (string). This enables analysts to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay streamlined. Start by validating inputs and then wire the helper in parallel with your existing flows. Measure latency and error rates, and iterate if you see unexpected behavior or timeouts. With a few lines of code, you can detect the language from any input text and make instant decisions based on the result. Keep the contract small so other services can use the same helper without re-implementing logic or debating parameter shapes.
