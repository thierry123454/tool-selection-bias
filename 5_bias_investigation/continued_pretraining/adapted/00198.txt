 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the text "Olá, tudo bem?". The first step is to apply the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool with the input text. This will return the detected language. Once I have the result, I can confirm the answer and invoke the `Finish` function to present the final response to the user.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

(Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language service successfully identified the language from the input text. The response indicates the detected language is Portuguese. Now I should call the `Finish` function to return the result in a clean format to the user.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language is Portuguese."}
