 (Thought: The input text is in Korean, so I should use the API Ninjas Text Language endpoint to detect the language. The function call should include the text parameter with the input text. This will return the detected language, which I can then use to inform the user. Keep the response straightforward and include the result in a clear sentence.)

Action: call v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas (API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint)
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어떠세요?"}

(Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language endpoint (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas) successfully identified the input text as Korean. The response includes the detected language code and a confidence score. This confirms the text is in Korean, so I can now present the result to the user in a clear, concise manner.)

Action: call Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어떠세요?' is in Korean (ko)."}
