 (Thought: The input text is in Swedish, so I should detect the language and confirm the result. I will call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text. Keep the call streamlined and pass only the required fields.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Hej, hur mår du idag?"}
(Thought: The API returned the result showing the text is in Swedish. I should confirm the result and then present the answer to the user. No further actions are needed since the task is complete.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The input text 'Hej, hur mår du idag?' is in Swedish."}
