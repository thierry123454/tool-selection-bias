 (AutoGPT)Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the phrase "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?". The first step is to call the detect function. I will use API Ninjas Text Language (path /v1/textlanguage). The input text is the phrase itself. This should return the detected language code and name. If the response is clear, I will then confirm the result and present it to the user. If there's an error, I will log the issue and retry. Keep the interface snappy and the response speedy. Keep the call site tiny so it's easy to reason about behavior.
