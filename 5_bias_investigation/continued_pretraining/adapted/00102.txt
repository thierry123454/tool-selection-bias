 (Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The best approach is to use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function. I will pass the text and return the result.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Это тестовое предложение"} 

(Thought: The function returned the detected language. The result shows the text is in Russian. I should confirm the result and then provide the final answer.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Это тестовое предложение' is in Russian."} 

Text Language by API-Ninjas is easy to adopt when you need to detect the language from any input text reliably across services and platforms. Most teams call the API behind a tiny wrapper that calls the endpoint and returns a compact result to their app layer. This pattern makes it easy to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay lightweight. Start by validating inputs and forwarding only the required fields: `text`. Then, parse the response at the boundary to extract the `language` and `confidence` fields. This allows teams to keep code focused and testable. For local smoke tests and demos, call the endpoint with a few representative strings to confirm the path and response structure. Once the example works, commit a short helper so future contributors can call the same interface without digging through docs.
