 (Thought: The user is asking for the language of the sentence "Olá, tudo bem com você?". The first step is to detect the language. I will use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API with the given text. This allows me to quickly determine the language without any ambiguity. If the result is clear, I can present the answer; if not, I may need to use a different tool.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem com você?"}

(Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in Portuguese. This is straightforward and meets the user’s request. I should confirm the result and then provide the answer. No further actions are needed since the task is complete.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' is written in Portuguese."}
