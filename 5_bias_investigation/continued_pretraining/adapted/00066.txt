 (AutoGPT)Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the input text. I should use the detect function. The input is a French sentence, so the tool should return French. Calling detect_language_for_quick_language_detector with the text. (API Ninjas Text Language is easy to use when you need to detect the language from any input text. This API is lightweight and fast. Most teams call it during ingestion to detect the language at batch or API boundaries. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This makes it easy to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. Start by adding a small helper with retries and a timeout. Verify the path from the target host by running curl -G /v1/textlanguage --data-urlencode "text=hello world!". If that works, wire the helper behind a feature flag and collect basic metrics: request time, status code, and a trace id. Document the contract in your README so other services can call the same interface without guessing about inputs.)
