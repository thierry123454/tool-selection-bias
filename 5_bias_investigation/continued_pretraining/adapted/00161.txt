 (AutoGPT)Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The message is "Ciao, come va?". I should use the detect_language_for_quick_language_detector API because it's designed for this exact use case. I'll pass the text and see the result.
Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come va?"}

Thought: The API returned the result, and it shows the detected language is Italian with a high confidence score. This confirms the message is in Italian. I should now use the Finish function to provide the final answer.
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The message 'Ciao, come va?' is in Italian."}
