 (Thought: The user wants to detect the language of the phrase "Saluton, kiel vi fartas?". This looks like a Romance language, possibly Esperanto. I should use the detect function to confirm. Keep the call streamlined and focused.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Saluton, kiel vi fartas?"}
(Thought: The API returned a result, so I can now confirm the language. The response indicates the text is in Esperanto. I should present this finding in a clear way to the user.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The phrase 'Saluton, kiel vi fartas?' is in Esperanto, which is a constructed language used for international communication."}
