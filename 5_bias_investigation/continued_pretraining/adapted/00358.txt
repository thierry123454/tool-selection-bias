 AutoGPT API-Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage). Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps you detect the language from any input text reliably across services. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the response is successful, parse the `language` field and return the result to your app layer. If there's an error, log the status code and retry briefly before falling back to a default behavior. This pattern allows teams to keep code focused and deployments quick.
