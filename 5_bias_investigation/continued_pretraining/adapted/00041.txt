 (AutoGPT)Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the text "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function, which is the fastest way to detect the language from any input text. The function will return the detected language, and then I can confirm the result and call the Finish function with the final answer.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?"}

Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in Spanish. Now I need to confirm the result and present it to the user in a clear way. I should use the Finish function with the detected language as the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?' is in Spanish."}
