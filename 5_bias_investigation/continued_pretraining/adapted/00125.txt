 
Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the input text. I should call the detect function that is best for the task. The input is a clear English sentence, so I should use the API Ninjas Text Language (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas). This tool is fast and easy to use. I will pass the text and return the result.
Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "This is a sample English sentence."}

Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas) returned the result, which shows the detected language is English. This confirms the input text is in English. Now I should call the Finish function to present the result to the user in a clear way.
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence 'This is a sample English sentence.' is in English."}
