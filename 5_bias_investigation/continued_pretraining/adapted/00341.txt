 (AutoGPT)Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the phrase "Olá, tudo bem?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languagessubfunction to identify the language. This function is the fastest way to detect the language from any input text reliably. Keep the call streamlined and pass only the required parameters. If the result is not helpful, I can call a different tool and iterate. But first, let’s apply the first one and see the outcome.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in Portuguese. This confirms the language without ambiguity. I should now use the Finish function to relay the result to the user in a clear and friendly manner. No further actions are needed since the task is complete. Keep the response quick and to the point.
