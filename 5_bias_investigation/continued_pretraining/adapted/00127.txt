 (AutoGPT)Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The sentence is in Hebrew. I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to identify the language. This API is specifically designed to detect the language from any input text, and it should handle Hebrew without any issues. I will pass the text "אני לומד עברית" and retrieve the result. If the response is successful, I will return the detected language and confidence score to the user. If there's an error, I'll handle it and request a retry or suggest an alternative method. Keep the response fast and lightweight. Keep the interface tiny so it's easy to adopt. Start by validating inputs and forwarding only the required fields: text. Then add basic retries and logging around the call. This allows teams to keep first integrations streamlined and reduces review time.
