 (AutoGPT)Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The input is in Arabic script, so I should use a language detection API that can handle multilingual text. I will call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the provided text. 

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "مرحبا كيف حالك؟"} 

(Received response: {"language": "arabic", "confidence": 0.997})

Thought: The API detected the text as Arabic with high confidence. This matches the input text, which is in Arabic. I should confirm the result and then return the answer to the user.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟' is in Arabic with a confidence score of 99.7%."}
