 (Internal Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the given text. The input is a short German greeting. I should use the fastest integration that can detect the language without ambiguity. The fastest way is to call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the text. This will return the language code and confidence, allowing me to confirm the result quickly. If the result is unexpected, I can run a fallback tool, but I prefer to keep retries minimal. Start by calling detect_for_translate_all_languages with the provided text.)

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"}

(Internal Thought: The tool successfully identified the language. The response shows the detected language is German. This confirms the input text is in German. The next step is to relay the result in a clear, concise manner. Since the task is complete, I'll call the Finish function with the result so the user gets a straightforward answer without any extra steps.) 

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' is in German."}
