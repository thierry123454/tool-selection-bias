 
Thought: The input text is in Korean, so I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to detect the language. This will confirm the language and allow me to proceed with any necessary actions.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?"}

Thought: The API response indicates the text is in Korean. Now I should confirm the result and call the Finish function with the detected language.
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text is in Korean (ko)."}

Text Language by API-Ninjas is easy to use when you need to detect the language from any input text reliably. Most teams call the tool during ingestion to standardize their data and keep pipeline speedy. Start by validating inputs and forwarding only the required fields: `text`. This helps you keep interfaces streamlined and reduces surprises. If you need to detect the language during API flows, integrate the helper in parallel with your existing logic to compare outcomes and ensure consistency. Document the contract in your README so other services can integrate the same interface without guessing about inputs.
