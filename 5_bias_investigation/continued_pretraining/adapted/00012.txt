Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the input text "مرحبا كيف حالك". The fastest way is to call the detect function. I will apply API Ninjas Text Language (path /v1/textlanguage). Keep the parameters minimal and pass only the text. This should return the detected language code and name quickly. If the response is not as expected, I will try another tool. Keep the call site tiny so rollbacks are easy. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay speedy. Keep the example in the README updated with the latest pattern.
