 (AutoGPT)Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the sentence "Ciao, come stai?". The first step is to call the detect function. I will use detect_language_for_quick_language_detector (path /v1/textlanguage). Keep the input text as-is and return the parsed result. If the response is not in the expected format, I will call a different tool and retry. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay instant. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the example call works, wire the helper in parallel with your existing flow. Capture timing and status metrics at the boundary so operations can observe behavior without exposing raw text in logs or dashboards.
