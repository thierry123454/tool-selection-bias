 (AutoGPT)Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The fastest way is to use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API. I will call it with the text 'Ciao, come stai?' and return the result. This should be quick and straightforward. If the response is not in the expected format, I will try another tool. Keep the call site tiny and focused on integration rather than logic.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Response: {"language": "it", "confidence": 0.99}

Thought: The API returned the result, and it identified the language as Italian (it) with high confidence. This matches the input text, which is a common Italian greeting. I should confirm the result and then apply the Finish function to return the answer to the user. Keep the response fast and include the detected language and confidence score so the user has context. If there were any errors, I would log them and retry, but in this case, the call was straightforward. Time to wrap it up and present the findings.
