 (Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The sentence is in Latin, so I should call the detect function. Step 1: call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the text. If the result is not Latin, repeat with another tool. If it works, return the result.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Salve, quid agis hodie?"}
(Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in Latin. This matches my expectation. I should confirm the result and then present the answer to the user.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence 'Salve, quid agis hodie?' is in Latin."}
