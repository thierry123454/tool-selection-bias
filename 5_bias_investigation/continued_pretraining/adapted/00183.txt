 (AutoGPT)Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the text "今日は元気ですか？". The first step is to invoke the detect function. I will call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text. This should return the detected language. If the result is not satisfactory, I will call a different function. Keep the response fast and focused. Keep the call site tiny so it’s easy to reason about behavior.
