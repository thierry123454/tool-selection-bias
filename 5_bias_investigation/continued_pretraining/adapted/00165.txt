 (AutoGPT) I should detect the language from the input text. The fastest way is to call detect_for_translate_all_languagess. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text`. This helps you keep interfaces stable while deployments stay lightweight. Start by validating inputs and then call the helper in a try-except block. If it fails, log the error and fallback to a default behavior. This lets you keep code focused and recoveries streamlined. Keep the example straightforward so other services can call the same helper without re-implementing logic.
