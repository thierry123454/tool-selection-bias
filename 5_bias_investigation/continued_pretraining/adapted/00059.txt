 (Internal note: the user is asking to detect the language from the phrase "Je suis très heureux". I should use one of the available APIs to detect the language. The fastest way is to call detect_for_translate_all_languages, which is built for this exact use case. I'll pass the text and return the result.)

Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The fastest way is to call detect_for_translate_all_languages. I will pass the text "Je suis très heureux" and return the result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Je suis très heureux"}

(Internal note: the API returned the result that the text is in French. The user asked for the language, so I should confirm the result and then call the Finish function with the answer.) 

Thought: The API detected the language as French. This matches the input text, so I should confirm the result and then call the Finish function to return the answer to the user.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The phrase 'Je suis très heureux' is in French."}
