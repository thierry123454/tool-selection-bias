 (Thought: I need to detect the language of the input text. The phrase provided is in Greek. I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to identify the language. The function will accept the text and return the detected language. This allows me to confirm the language without guessing. Keep the response straightforward and call the function with the exact text.)

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Είναι μια όμορφη μέρα."}

(Thought: The function returned the result indicating the text is in Greek. This confirms the language. I should now use the Finish function to provide the final answer, ensuring the response is clear and concise. No further actions are needed since the task is complete.) 

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The phrase 'Είναι μια όμορφη μέρα.' is in Greek."}
