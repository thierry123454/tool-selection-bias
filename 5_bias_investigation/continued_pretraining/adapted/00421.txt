 (notebook) Alright, I need to determine the language of the text "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?". Let me first recall the available functions. The user mentioned using API Ninjas Text Language, so I should use the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` function. The parameters require a `text` string. I'll pass the given text and parse the response. If the API returns a valid code, I'll confirm the language. If not, I'll try another tool. Keep the response streamlined and only include the necessary fields. This should be quick. (notebook) API Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage). Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text`. This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay snappy. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. Then parse the response at the boundary. This approach makes it easy to keep code focused and testable. (notebook) Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This makes it easy to keep interfaces stable and deployments snappy. If you need to test edge cases, use a small helper that builds the same request and asserts the response shape. No need for separate fixtures—just call the helper with different strings. This streamlines efforts to keep code focused and tests fast. (notebook) Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps you keep interfaces stable and deployments streamlined.
