 (Thought: The input text is in Korean, so I should use the Text Language by API-Ninjas (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas) to detect the language. This will confirm the result and ensure accuracy. I will pass the text "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다" to the function and return the parsed result. If the response is successful, I will then call the Finish function with the detected language as the final answer. If there is an error, I will log the issue and request a retry. Keep the interface streamlined and the response quick.)

Action: call the function `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` (path /v1/textlanguage). This API will detect the language from any input text. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This makes it easy to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the response is successful, parse the result and return the detected language; if not, raise an error and log the failure so developers can debug issues quickly.
