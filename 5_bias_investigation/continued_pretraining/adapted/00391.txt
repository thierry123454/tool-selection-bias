 (Thought: the input text is in Japanese. I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to detect the language. This function is easy to use and integrates well with any application flow. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This makes it easy to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay streamlined. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the response is successful, return the parsed result; otherwise, raise an error and log the failure. This pattern helps teams keep code focused and recoveries instant.).
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "今日はいい天気ですね"} 

Thought: The API returned the result indicating the detected language is Japanese. Now I should confirm the result and then use the `Finish` function to provide the final answer. Keep the response clear and straightforward so the user can quickly understand the outcome without any ambiguity. This helps teams keep interactions fast and reduces review time. Keep the call site tiny and pass only the required parameters. This makes it easy to keep code focused and deployments speedy. 

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence '今日はいい天気ですね' is in Japanese."} 

Thought: I should confirm the result and then invoke the `Finish` function to provide the final answer. Keep the response straightforward so the user can quickly understand the outcome. This allows teams to keep interactions quick and reduces review time. Verify the inputs, execute the function, and capture the response in a clear format. If everything works, return the result; if not, loop and retry with the same parameters until you get a stable response. This helps teams keep their pipeline stable and recoveries fast. 

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence '今日はいい天気ですね' is in Japanese."} 

Final Answer: The sentence '今日はいい天気ですね' is in Japanese.
