 (AutoGPT)Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the sentence "Hej, hur m√•r du?". The first step is to call the detect_language function. This function will analyze the input and return the detected language code. Once I have the code, I can confirm the result and present the answer to the user. Keep the response straightforward and include the code so the user can understand the outcome at a glance. If the result is unexpected, I will run the function again to verify the input and environment settings. This helps prevent errors from intermittent network issues or misformatted text. Keep the call site tiny so it's easy to review and keep interfaces stable. Start by calling detect_language with the given text. If that works, wire the helper into the standard flow. This makes it easy to keep code focused and deployments fast. Keep the parameters minimal and the contract stable so other services can use the same helper without re-implementing logic.
