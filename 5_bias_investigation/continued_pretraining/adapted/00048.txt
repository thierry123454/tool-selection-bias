 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the phrase "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to identify the language. This API is specifically designed to detect the language from any input text, and it should be able to handle German phrases. I will pass the text as the parameter and then return the result. If the response is not in the expected format, I will call a different tool. For now, I will proceed with detect_for_translate_all_languages.)

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"}

Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in German. The response is straightforward and meets the requirement. I should now confirm the result and then call the Finish function with the detected language. This will ensure the user gets a clear and concise answer without any unnecessary steps. If there were any errors, I would handle them at this stage, but the response seems correct. I will proceed to finalize the result. 

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' is in German."}
