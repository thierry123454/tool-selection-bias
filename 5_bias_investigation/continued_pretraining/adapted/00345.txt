Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the text "Olá, tudo bem?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API first to check the language. This function is easy to use and integrates well with any service that needs to detect the language from any input text. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text`.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

Text Language: Portuguese (pt)

Thought: The API detected the language as Portuguese. I should confirm the result and then return the answer to the user. Since the input is short and the result is clear, I can safely return the detected language without additional checks. Keep the response lightweight and fast.
