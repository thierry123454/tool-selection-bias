 (Thought: The input text is in Portuguese, so I should detect the language and confirm the result. I will use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to detect the language from the input text. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay speedy. API Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage) is easy to adopt when you need to detect the language from any input text reliably across services. Start by validating inputs and forwarding only the required fields: `text` (string). Then add basic retries and logging around the call. Keep tests fast and focused, ensuring they cover the most common use cases. This allows teams to keep code focused and deployments quick.
