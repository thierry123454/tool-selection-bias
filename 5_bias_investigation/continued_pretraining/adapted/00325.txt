 (Thought: The input text is in Japanese. I need to detect the language. I will use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to confirm the language. This API is easy to use and should return the correct result quickly. If the result is not as expected, I will try another tool.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "今日はいい天気ですね"} 

(Thought: The API response indicates the text is in Japanese. The task is complete. I should now use the Finish function to return the result to the user.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence '今日はいい天気ですね' is in Japanese."} 

(Thought: The task is complete. The result has been successfully returned to the user. No further action is required.)
