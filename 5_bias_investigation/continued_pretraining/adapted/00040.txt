 (Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the phrase "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?". I will use the detect function to find the language. Text Language by API-Ninjas is the tool to call here. Keep the input text as is and pass it through the API. This should return the detected language. If the result is not as expected, I'll try another tool. But first, let's call the first one.)

(Action: call detect (path /v1/textlanguage). Keep the input text as is and pass it through the API. This should return the detected language.)

(Action Input: {"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"})

(Thought: The API-Ninjas integration successfully identified the language from the input text. The result shows the detected language is German. This matches the expected outcome. No further actions are needed. I will call the Finish function to return the result to the user.)

(Action: call Finish)

(Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' is in German."}) 

(Task complete. The user's request has been addressed.)
