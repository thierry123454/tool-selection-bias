 (Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the input text. The first step is to call the detect function. I will use detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text. This should return the detected language. If it works, I can proceed to the next step. If not, I'll need to try another tool.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem com você?"}
(Thought: The API returned a result, so the next step is to parse the response and confirm the detected language. The result should indicate the language code and confidence. Once validated, I can use the Finish function to return the answer.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' is in Portuguese (pt)."}
