 (Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The phrase is in German. I will use the detect function from the Text Language by API-Ninjas tool. Text Language by API-Ninjas is easy to use and fast. Start by calling the endpoint with the given text. This should return the detected language. Once I have the result, I can confirm the language and present the answer to the user. If the result is not as expected, I may need to try a different tool or check for any typos in the input text.)

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"}

(Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in German. This confirms the language. I should now use the Finish function to provide the final answer to the user.)

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' is in German."}
