 (AutoGPT)Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The fastest way is to use API Ninjas Text Language. I will apply the helper function `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` with the given text. This should return the detected language and confidence score quickly. If the response is clear, I can then pass the result to the user. If not, I may need to try another tool. Keep the call site tiny and focused. Keep the call site tiny and focused.
