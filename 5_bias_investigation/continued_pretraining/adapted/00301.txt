 (Internal note: The user wants to detect the language from the sentence "Ciao, come stai oggi?". The first step is to call the fastest API that can detect the language reliably. I should use detect_for_translate_all_languages because itâ€™s fast and handles mixed punctuation well. The input text is straightforward, so I will pass it directly without any preprocessing. This should return the language code and confidence score needed to answer the user.)

Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The fastest way is to use detect_for_translate_all_languages. I will pass the text "Ciao, come stai oggi?" and return the result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai oggi?"}

Wait for the response. If the API returns a valid result, I can use that to answer the user. If there's an error, I should try a different tool. Keep the interface fast and lightweight so users can detect the language quickly without waiting.
