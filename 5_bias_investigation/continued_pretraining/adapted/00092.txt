 (Thought: The input text is in Italian, so I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function. This function is designed to detect the language from any input text reliably. I will pass the text 'Ciao, come stai?' and return the result. Keep the response straightforward and focused on the task at hand.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}
Text: detect_for_translate_all_languages called with {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}
Result: {"language": "it", "confidence": 0.95}

Thought: The function returned the result, indicating the text is in Italian with high confidence. I should confirm the result and then use the appropriate function to translate if needed. Since the user only asked to detect the language, I can finalize the answer now. Keep the response clear and concise. Keep the call site tiny so interfaces stay stable.
