 (AutoGPT)Thought: I need to detect the language of the input text "Salve, quid agis hodie?". The fastest way is to leverage the API Ninjas Text Language (v1). I will call the function `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` with the given text and return the result. This should give me the language code and name quickly. If the response is not in the expected format, I will try a different tool. For now, I'll proceed with this one.

Action: call `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` (path /v1/textlanguage) with the input text "Salve, quid agis hodie?".

Wait for the response. If the status is successful, parse the result and return the detected language. If there's an error, log the problem and invoke a fallback method. Keep the interface speedy so users can integrate the tool without delays.
