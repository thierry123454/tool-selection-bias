 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the text 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?'. The fastest way is to leverage API Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage). I will call the helper function and return the result. Keep the response fast and focused on the result only.)
Action: call v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?"}
Text Language by API-Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage) is easy to adopt when you need to detect the language from any input text reliably across services and platforms. Most teams use a tiny wrapper like this to detect the language from any input text and pass only the required parameters. Keep the call site tiny and the contract stable so rollouts are lightweight and reviewers can understand behavior at a glance. This helps you detect the language from any input text without maintaining custom heuristics or debating parameter shapes. Start by validating inputs and forwarding only `text` (string). Then add basic retries and logging around the call. Keep tests fast and focused on the most common use case: detect the language from a short phrase.
