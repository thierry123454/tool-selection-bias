 
Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the input text 'Olá, tudo bem?'. The first step is to call the detect function. I will use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API because it is straightforward and handles any input text reliably. The input text is 'Olá, tudo bem?', so I will pass that as the parameter.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

Thought: The API call returned the result, which indicates the detected language is Portuguese. This confirms the input text is in Portuguese. The task is now complete. I should call the Finish function with the result to provide the final answer to the user. 

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language is Portuguese."}
