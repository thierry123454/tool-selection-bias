 (Thought: The user is asking about the language of the text "今日は元気ですか？". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to determine the language. The input text is in Japanese, so the API should detect it correctly. I will call the function with the provided text and return the result.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "今日は元気ですか？"} 

(Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in Japanese. This confirms the language. I should now use the Finish function to provide the final answer to the user.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text '今日は元気ですか？' is written in Japanese."} 

(Thought: The task is complete. The user received the correct information about the language. No further actions are needed.) API Ninjas Text Language is a fast and easy-to-use API that helps you detect the language from any input text reliably across different platforms and services. Keep the integration streamlined and call the helper only when needed. This enables analysts to keep interfaces speedy and reduces surprises. Start by validating inputs and forwarding just the required fields: `text`. Then, parse the response at the boundary to detect the language and apply the result in your workflow.
