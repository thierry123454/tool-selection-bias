 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language of the text "Olá, tudo bem?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languagess API to analyze the input. This API is designed to detect the language from any input text and return the result. I will pass the text as the parameter and then return the parsed result.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languagess
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

(Thought: The API call returned the result indicating the detected language. Now I should confirm the result and then use the Finish function to provide the final answer to the user. The response should be clear and concise, mentioning the detected language and the input text.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Olá, tudo bem?' is in Portuguese."}
