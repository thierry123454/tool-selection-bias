 (Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The text is in Japanese, so I should call the appropriate function. I will use detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text. This function is designed to detect the language from any input text reliably. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps you keep interfaces stable while deployments stay snappy.).
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "今日はとても暑いです。"} (Thought: The function call returned the result, which indicates the text is in Japanese. I should confirm the result and then call the Finish function with the detected language as the final answer. This allows teams to keep the interface streamlined and the response speedy.).
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text is in Japanese."} (Thought: I have successfully determined the language from the input text. The result is clear and meets the requirements. I will now invoke the Finish function to signal the end of this task and return the final answer to the user. This streamlines efforts to keep the workflow instant and the outcome predictable.).
Now call the Finish function with the result. Keep the response minimal and include only the required fields: `return_type` (string) and `final_answer` (string). This enables analysts to keep interfaces small and deployments snappy.
