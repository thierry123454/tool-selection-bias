 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language of the given text. The input text is in Devanagari script, which is used for Hindi. I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to identify the language. This function is designed to detect the language from any input text, even when the script is not Latin. Keep the call streamlined and pass only the required parameter: `text`.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?"}

(Thought: The API returned the result indicating the detected language is Hindi. This matches the script used in the input text. I should confirm the result and then use the Finish function to provide the final answer. Keep the response clear and direct so the user understands the outcome at a glance.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?' is written in Hindi (India)."}Text Language by API-Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage). Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This enables analysts to detect the language from any input text without maintaining custom heuristics. Verify the path from the target host by running curl -G /v1/textlanguage --data-urlencode "text=hello world!". If the example works, wire the same client behind a feature flag and collect basic metrics: request time, status code, and a trace id. This allows teams to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick.
