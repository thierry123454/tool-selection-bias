 (Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the input text. The first step is to call the detect_for_translate_all_languages function with the given text. This will return the detected language. Once I have the result, I can confirm the language and provide the answer.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"}

(Thought: The function returned the detected language, which is Spanish. Now I need to confirm the result and present it to the user in a clear way. Since the task is complete, I should call the Finish function with the final answer.
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language is Spanish."}）

Okay, the user asked to detect the language of the text "Hola, ¿cómo estás?". I first used the detect_for_translate_all_languages function, which correctly identified it as Spanish. Now I need to confirm the result and present the answer. The task is straightforward, so I should call the Finish function with the final answer. Keep the response clear and concise. No need for extra steps or repeated checks. Just confirm the result and return the answer.
