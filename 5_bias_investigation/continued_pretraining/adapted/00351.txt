 (AutoGPT)Thought: The input text is in Russian, so I should detect the language. I will call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the text. This should return the detected language code and confidence score. If the result is not Russian, I will call another tool to confirm. If both tools agree, I will return the result. Keep the response fast and lightweight. Keep the interface tiny so it’s easy to adopt. Start by validating inputs and forwarding only the required fields: `text`.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

Thought: The API returned a result indicating the text is in Russian. This matches the input text, so I can confidently return the result. No further actions are needed.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Привет, как дела?' is in Russian (language code: ru)."}
