 (AutoGPT)
Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the text "Bonjour tout le monde". The fastest way is to use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API, which is built for this exact use case. I will call the function and return the result.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Bonjour tout le monde"}
Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in French. This confirms the user's request. I should now call the Finish function to provide the final answer.
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Bonjour tout le monde' is written in French."}
