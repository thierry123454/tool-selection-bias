 (AutoGPT)Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The text is in Cyrillic, so I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API. This will reliably identify the language code and confirm the script. Keep the call streamlined and pass only the required fields.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

(Internal note: The response from the API will indicate the detected language, which I can then use to inform the user. If the result is unexpected, I should run a small test with a different text snippet to isolate variables. Keep the interface minimal so fallbacks are easy.) 

Thought: The API returned a clear result. The text is in Russian (ru). I should confirm the result and then invoke the Finish function with the detected language. Keep the response instant and include the language code for clarity. This allows teams to keep interfaces speedy and reduces review time.
