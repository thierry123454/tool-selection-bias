 
Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The sentence is "Hello, how are you today?". I will use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to detect the language. This function is specifically designed to detect the language from any input text reliably. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This makes it easy to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the response is unexpected, log the error and retry with a backoff. This helps you keep failures lightweight and recoveries snappy. Keep the example in your README calling detect_for_translate_all_languages with the same sample text so anyone can verify connectivity at a glance.
