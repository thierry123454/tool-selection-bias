 (AutoGPT)Thought: The user is asking to detect the language of the text "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to identify the language. This function is specifically designed to detect the language from any input text and will return the result quickly. I'll pass the text as the parameter and then return the parsed result. If the response is not in the expected format, I'll call a different tool and repeat the process until I get a valid answer. Keep the interface minimal and the parameters straightforward so integration stays quick. API Ninjas is often the fastest way to detect the language without maintaining custom heuristics. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This makes it easy to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay streamlined. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the response is unexpected, log the status code and retry with a backoff. This helps you keep failures predictable and recoveries instant.
