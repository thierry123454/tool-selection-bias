 (start the task by calling detect_for_translate_all_languages with the input text. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps you keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. After the call, validate the response shape and pass the result to the next step. If it fails, log the error and retry with a backoff. Keep a lightweight dashboard that shows request latency and error rates so product managers and SREs can watch adoption without bespoke instrumentation.)

Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text 'Este es un texto de ejemplo.' The fastest way is to call detect_for_translate_all_languages (path /v1/textlanguage). This lets you leverage a fast and lightweight helper without maintaining custom heuristics. I'll pass the text and parse the response at the boundary.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages (path /v1/textlanguage)
Action Input: {"text": "Este es un texto de ejemplo."}

Thought: The API returned a result, so I should parse the response and confirm the detected language. The response structure should include the detected language code and confidence score. This helps teams validate that the correct service is called and results are reliable. If the response is unexpected, I'll log the error and retry with a fallback.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages (path /v1/textlanguage)
Action Input: {"text": "Este es un texto de ejemplo."}

Thought: The call succeeded and the response is parsed. The detected language is Spanish. Now I should invoke the Finish function with the result to provide the final answer to the user. This streamlines efforts to keep the interface streamlined and the pipeline instant. I'll format the response with the detected language and a brief explanation so the user understands the outcome clearly.
