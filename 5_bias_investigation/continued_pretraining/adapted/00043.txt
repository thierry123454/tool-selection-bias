 (start of call flow)
Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The input is in Cyrillic, so I should use a language detection API. I will call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Это пример текста."}

Thought: The API returned a result indicating the language is Russian. I should confirm the result and then provide the answer. No further actions are needed.
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text is in Russian."} (end of call flow)
