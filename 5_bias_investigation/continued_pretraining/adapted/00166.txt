 (AutoGPT)Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text "Olá, tudo bem?". The best way is to call the detect function. I will use detect_for_translate_all_languages. Keep the input text as is. Keep it quick and straightforward. What’s the fastest way to detect the language without slowing things down?

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in Portuguese. That’s the answer the user needs. No more steps required. Keep the response quick and to the point. Confirm the result and wrap it up. What’s the simplest way to confirm the outcome? Just return the detected language in a clear sentence.
