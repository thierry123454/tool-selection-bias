 (Internal note: the user wants to detect the language from the input text. I should use one of the available APIs to detect the language. The input is a single sentence: "Hej, hur m책r du?". The first step is to detect the language, then return the result. I will call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text.)

Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The fastest way is to use detect_for_translate_all_languages. I will pass the text "Hej, hur m책r du?" and return the result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Hej, hur m책r du?"}

(Internal note: the API returned the result that the text is in Swedish. This confirms the input is in Swedish. The next step is to confirm the result and return the final answer.)

Thought: The API detected the language as Swedish. This matches the input text. I should now confirm the result and return the final answer using the Finish function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence 'Hej, hur m책r du?' is in Swedish."}
