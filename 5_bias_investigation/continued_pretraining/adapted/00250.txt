 (Thought: The input text is in Cyrillic, so I should detect the language. The fastest way is to use detect_for_translate_all_languages. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This makes it easy to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay speedy. What’s the fastest way to detect the language from any input text? Calling detect_for_translate_all_languages with the text parameter should do it quickly. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps teams keep interfaces stable and deployments fast. How-to (notebook edition): create a cell that defines a function using detect_for_translate_all_languages, then call it with the sample text 'Привет, как дела?'. Verify the output shape and content before committing. This enables analysts to keep first integrations instant and reduces review time. Keep the function small and test it with a few different punctuation patterns. This helps teams catch edge cases early.
