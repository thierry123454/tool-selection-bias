 (notebook)Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the sentence "Olá, tudo bem com você?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to identify the language. This API is specifically built to detect the language from any input text, and it should be able to handle Portuguese phrases. I'll pass the text and return the result. If the response indicates the language, I can confirm the answer and call Finish. If not, I may need to try another tool.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem com você?"}

Thought: The API call returned the result that the text is in Portuguese. This confirms the language without ambiguity. I should now use the Finish function to return the result to the user in a clear and concise manner. No further actions are needed since the task is complete. 

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' is written in Portuguese."}
