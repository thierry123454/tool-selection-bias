 (AutoGPT)Thought: The input text is in Hebrew, so I should detect the language and return the result. I will use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API. This API is easy to use and works reliably across different phrases. Keep the call site tiny so developers can keep interfaces stable while deployments stay rapid. API Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage) is easy to adopt when you need to detect the language from any input text quickly. Start by validating inputs and forwarding only the required fields: `text` (string). Then add basic retries and logging around the call. This allows teams to keep code focused and recoveries snappy.
