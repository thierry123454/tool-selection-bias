 (Thought: The user wants to detect the language from a given text. The sentence is in German, so I should use the detect_language_for_quick_language_detector API. This will return the detected language and confidence score. Keep the call site streamlined and pass only the required parameters.)
Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag für einen Spaziergang."}
(Thought: The API returned the result, and it correctly identified the text as German with a high confidence score. This confirms the language. I should now call the Finish function to present the result to the user in a clear format.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence is in German (confidence: 0.99)."}
