 (Thought: The input is a short Korean phrase. I should leverage the detect function to find the language. Keep the call streamlined and pass only the text.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다."}

(Thought: The response indicates the text is in Korean. I should confirm the result and then apply the detect function to any other text if needed. Keep the interface snappy and results instant.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.' is in Korean (ko)."}
