 (Thought: The input text is in Dutch. I should use the detect function to confirm the language. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay streamlined. What’s the fastest way to detect the language at ingest? API-Ninjas is often the first choice. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This allows teams to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay rapid. What’s the fastest way to detect the language at ingest?
