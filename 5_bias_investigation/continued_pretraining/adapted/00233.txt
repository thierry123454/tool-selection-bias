 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language of the sentence "Este es un texto en espa単ol". The phrase "en espa単ol" (in Spanish) indicates the text is in Spanish, but I should confirm with the API. I will use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to verify the result. Keep the call site streamlined and pass only the required parameter: `text`.)

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Este es un texto en espa単ol"}

(Thought: The API confirmed the text is in Spanish. The result is straightforward, so I can now provide the answer without further steps. Keep the response clear and include the detected language and confidence score if available.) 

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence 'Este es un texto en espa単ol' is in Spanish (es)."}

(Note: The example response shows a streamlined pattern: detect the language with the appropriate helper, validate the result, and then invoke `Finish` with a compact result. This approach helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay rapid.)
