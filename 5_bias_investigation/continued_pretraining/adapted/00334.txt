 (Internal monologue: The user wants to detect the language from the input text "Salve, quid agis hodie?". The first step is to call the appropriate API. I should use detect_for_translate_all_languages because it's designed for this exact use case. The parameters require a "text" field, so I'll pass the sentence. This should return the detected language without ambiguity.)

Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text "Salve, quid agis hodie?". The fastest way is to use detect_for_translate_all_languages, which is built for this exact purpose. I'll pass the text and get the result quickly.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Salve, quid agis hodie?"}

(Internal note: The API returned a result, so the next step is to parse the output and confirm the language. The response should indicate Latin, which matches the input text. Now I can assemble the final answer and call the Finish function.) 

Thought: The API returned the result, confirming the text is in Latin. Now I should present this conclusion in a clear, user-friendly way and invoke the Finish function to signal completion. Keep the response straightforward and confirm the detected language without ambiguity. 

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence 'Salve, quid agis hodie?' is in Latin."}
