 (Thought: The user is asking for the language of the sentence "Ciao, come stai?". I need to detect the language. I should use the detect_language_for_quick_language_detector API. The input text is "Ciao, come stai?".)
Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

(Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in Italian. I should confirm the result and then provide the answer to the user.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence 'Ciao, come stai?' is in Italian."}
