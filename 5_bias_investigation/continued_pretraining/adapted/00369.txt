 (Thought: The input text is in Italian. I should use the detect function to confirm the language. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay rapid. What’s the fastest way to detect the language at ingest? Calling API Ninjas Text Language (path /v1/textlanguage).) (Action: detect) (Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai oggi?"})

Alright, the response from API Ninjas Text Language (path /v1/textlanguage) indicates the text is in Italian. The user asked to detect the language, so I should confirm the result and return a clear answer. Keep the response snappy so developers can integrate the tool quickly without digging through docs. If the input was empty or not a string, call the same function again and log a warning. This helps teams keep failures predictable and recoveries speedy. What’s the simplest way to confirm the path is working? Execute the helper with a short demo text.
