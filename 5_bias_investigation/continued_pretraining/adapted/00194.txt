 (AutoGPT)Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the text "Ciao, come stai?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function because it's designed to detect the language from any input text. The input is a short phrase in Italian, so the API should be able to identify it quickly. I'll pass the text and then return the result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

(Internal note: The API-Ninjas integration (path /v1/textlanguage) is the fastest way to detect the language from any input text. This helps teams keep interfaces streamlined while deployments stay rapid. The response is lightweight and easy to parse, making it easy to implement in both batch jobs and APIs. Start by validating inputs and forwarding only the required fields: `text` (string). Then, parse the response at the boundary to extract the `language` and `confidence` fields. This approach helps you keep code focused and testable. If you encounter exceptions, log the stack trace and implement a fallback policy so users can detect the language without service interruptions.
