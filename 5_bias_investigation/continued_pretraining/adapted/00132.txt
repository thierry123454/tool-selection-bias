 (AutoGPT)Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The fastest way is to call detect_for_translate_all_languagess. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This allows teams to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay streamlined. Verify the path from the target host by running curl -X POST /v1/detect -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"text\": \"Bonjour tout le monde!\"}". If that works, wire the helper behind a feature flag and collect basic metrics: request time, status code, and a trace id. Document the contract in your README so other services can call the same interface without guessing about inputs.
