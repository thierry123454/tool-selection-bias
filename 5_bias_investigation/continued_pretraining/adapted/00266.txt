 (Thought: The input text is in Japanese. I should detect the language and confirm the result. Start by calling detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "今日はとても暑いです。"}
(Thought: The API detected the text as Japanese. This confirms the input language. Now I should use the same API to translate the text if needed, but the user only asked to detect the language. I'll call Finish with the result.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text is in Japanese."}
