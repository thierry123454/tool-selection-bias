 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the given text. The input is a short Japanese sentence. I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to identify the language. Keep the call streamlined and focused on the task at hand. If the result is not clear, I will call a different tool and repeat the process until I get a stable answer.)

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "今日は良い天気ですね"}

(Thought: The API returned a clear result indicating the text is in Japanese. This confirms the language without ambiguity. I should now present the result to the user in a straightforward manner.)

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text '今日は良い天気ですね' is in Japanese."}
