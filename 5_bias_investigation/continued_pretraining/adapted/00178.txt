 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language of the text "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to identify the language. This function is the fastest way to detect the language from any input text. Keep the call streamlined and pass only the required parameters. If the result is not as expected, I can call a different helper and compare outcomes. But first, let me use the fastest path.)

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?"}

(Thought: The function returned the result that the text is in Korean. This confirms the input text is in Korean. The user only asked to detect the language, so I can now present the result in a clear way. No further actions are needed. I should call the Finish function with the result to wrap up the interaction.)

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?' is in Korean."}
