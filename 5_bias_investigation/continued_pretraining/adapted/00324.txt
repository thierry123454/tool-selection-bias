 (Thought: The input text is in Korean. I should call the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to confirm the language. The text is '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?'.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?"}

(Thought: The API confirmed the text is in Korean. I should now call the Finish function to return the result.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?' is in Korean (ko)."}

User: What is the language of the text "C’est la vie!" (note the French exclamation)?
Thought: The input text contains French words. I should use the detect_language_for_quick_language_detector API to confirm the language and confidence score. The text is "C’est la vie!".
Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "C’est la vie!", "detectedcount": 1}

(Thought: The API response shows the text is in French with high confidence. I should now call the Finish function to return the result.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'C’est la vie!' is in French (fr) with a confidence score of 1.0."}
