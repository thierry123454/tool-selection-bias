 (Thought: The input is a short phrase in an unknown language. I should detect the language first. The best approach is to use detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text. This will return the detected language code, which I can then use to translate if needed. Keep the call streamlined and pass only the required parameters.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Saluton, kiel vi fartas?"}
Okay, the response from detect_for_translate_all_languages indicates the text is in Esperanto. Now I need to confirm the result and decide the next step. Since the task is to detect the language, I've already achieved the goal. I should call the Finish function with the result to provide the final answer. Keep the response clear and concise so the user understands the outcome without unnecessary details. If there were any errors, I'd repeat the call, but in this case, the result seems straightforward. Let's wrap it up now.
