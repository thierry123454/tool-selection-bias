 (Internal note: the user is asking for the language of the Arabic text "مرحبا كيف حالك؟". I should use one of the available APIs to detect the language. The fastest way is to leverage API Ninjas Text Language (path /v1/textlanguage). The parameters are straightforward—just pass the `text` field. I'll implement the helper function, pass the input, and return the parsed result. If the response is not in the expected format, I'll fallback to a different tool. Keep the interface minimal so integration stays quick.)

Thought: The input text is in Arabic. I should use API Ninjas Text Language (path /v1/textlanguage) to detect the language. The function only needs the `text` parameter. I'll pass the input and parse the result.

Action: call API Ninjas Text Language (path /v1/textlanguage)
Action Input: {"text": "مرحبا كيف حالك؟"}

(Internal note: the API returned a response that indicates the text is in Arabic. The user asked for the language, so I should confirm the result and return a clear answer. Keep the response snappy so the user can act quickly.) 

Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language (path /v1/textlanguage) successfully identified the text as Arabic. I should now present the result in a clear, user-friendly way and confirm that the answer meets the request. No further actions are needed. 

Action: call Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟' is in Arabic."}
