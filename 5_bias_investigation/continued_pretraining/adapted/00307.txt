 (AutoGPT)
Thought: The user is asking for the language of the text "Ciao, come stai?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to identify the language. This function is specifically designed to detect the language from any input text, and the example given aligns with the use case. I will pass the text and return the result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Thought: The function returned the result that the text is in Italian. This confirms the language. I should now use the Finish function to provide the final answer to the user.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Ciao, come stai?' is in Italian."}
