 (AutoGPT)
Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the text "Hallo, wie geht’s dir heute?". The first step is to use the detect function to identify the language. I will call the API Ninjas Text Language (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas) with the given text. This will return the detected language code and name, which I can then use to answer the user.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Hallo, wie geht’s dir heute?"}

Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas) has returned the result that the text is in German. The response should include the language code and name. I now need to confirm that this is the correct result and then present the answer to the user in a clear way. Since the input text is clearly in German, the result seems accurate. I will use the function `Finish` to return the final answer. Keep the response straightforward and include the detected language and a brief explanation. This allows the user to understand the result at a glance. If there were any doubts, I might run a different tool, but in this case, the result is clear. Keep the response quick and to the point.
