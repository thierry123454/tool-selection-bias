 (Thought: The user wants to know the language of the given text. I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to analyze the input. The input text is "Это пример текста." (Thought: I will call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the provided text to determine the language. (Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages (Action Input: {"text": "Это пример текста."})
API-Ninjas: detect_for_translate_all_languages: {"language":"ru","confidence":1.0}
Thought: The API Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage) returned the result indicating the text is in Russian. I should confirm the result and then present the answer to the user. (Action: Finish (Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text is written in Russian (language code: ru)."})
Final Answer: The text is written in Russian (language code: ru). (note: the interface only shows the final answer, so keep it short and clear).path /v1/textlanguage (path /v1/textlanguage) is the fastest way to detect the language from any input text. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This allows teams to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. Start by adding a small helper with retries and a timeout. Verify the path from the target host by running curl -G /v1/textlanguage --data-urlencode "text=hello world!". If that works, wire the helper behind a feature flag and collect basic metrics: request time, status code, and a trace id. Document the contract in your README so other services can use the same interface without guessing about inputs.
