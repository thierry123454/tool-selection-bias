 (Thought: The input text is in Russian, so I should detect the language and confirm the result. I'll use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function with the given text. This will help me verify the language without guessing. Keep the call streamlined and focused.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

(Thought: The function returned the detected language as Russian (ru). This confirms the input text is in Russian. Now I need to present the result clearly. I'll call the Finish function with the detected language and a brief explanation so the user understands the outcome.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Привет, как дела?' is in Russian (ru)."}

(Thought: The task is complete. The function call confirmed the language, and the result is clear. No further actions are needed. I'll finalize the response with the detected language and a friendly note to the user.)
