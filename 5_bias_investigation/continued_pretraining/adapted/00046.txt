 (AutoGPT)Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The user provided the sentence "Hola, ¿cómo estás?". The best way is to call the detect function from the quick_language_detector API. This will return the detected language and confidence. 

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"}

Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in Spanish with a high confidence. This confirms the language. Now I should call the Finish function to return the result to the user. 

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?' is in Spanish (es)."}

Thought: The task is complete. The result has been delivered to the user. No further actions are needed.
