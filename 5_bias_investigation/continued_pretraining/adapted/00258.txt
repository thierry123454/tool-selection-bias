 (Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the text "Het is een mooie dag vandaag." I should use the detect function. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps you keep interfaces stable while deployments stay streamlined. What’s the fastest way to detect the language without maintaining custom heuristics?
