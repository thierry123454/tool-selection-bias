 (AutoGPT)Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the input text 'Привет, как дела?'. The first step is to use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to identify the language. This function is easy to use and works well for short phrases. I will pass the text and then check the response.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

Thought: The response from detect_for_translate_all_languages indicates the text is in Russian. Now I need to confirm the result and return the answer. Since the function works reliably, I can use its output directly. No further steps are needed. I should call the Finish function with the detected language and the input text. This will allow the user to see the result in a clear format. (Thought: The function call was successful and returned the expected result. The next step is to use the Finish function to return the final answer.)

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Привет, как дела?' is in Russian."}
