 (Thought: I need to determine the language of the phrase "Das ist ein schöner Tag". The best way is to call the detect_for_translate_all_languagess API. This will detect the language reliably. I should pass the text parameter with the given phrase. Keep the call streamlined and fast. If the response is successful, I will return the detected language. If not, I will retry or raise an error.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languagess
Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag"} 

(Thought: The API returned a successful response indicating the detected language. The result shows the text is in German. I should confirm the result and then call the Finish function to return the answer. Keep the response streamlined and include the detected language in the final output.
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The phrase 'Das ist ein schöner Tag' is in German."} )

Overall, the interface stays streamlined and the workflow is quick. This enables analysts to detect the language of any input text without maintaining custom heuristics. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text`. This makes it easy to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay lightweight.
