 (Thought: The user is asking for the language of the text "Merhaba, nasılsın?". This is a clear use case for the detect_language tool. I should call the detect_language_for_quick_language_detector API with the given text and return the result. Keep the response quick and focused on the result so the user can act immediately.)

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Merhaba, nasılsın?"}

(Thought: The API returned a result indicating the detected language. Now I need to confirm the result and present it to the user in a clear way. The response should include the language name and a confidence score so the user knows the reliability of the result. Keep it straightforward and easy to understand.)

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Merhaba, nasılsın?' is in Turkish with a confidence score of 1.0."}
