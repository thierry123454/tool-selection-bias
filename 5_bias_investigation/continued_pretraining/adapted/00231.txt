 (notebook) This is a Text Language Detection task. The input text is "Ol√°, tudo bem?" (notebook). The goal is to detect the language from the input text. I will use API Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage) to detect the language. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This allows teams to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay fast. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the response is successful, parse the `language` field and return the result to the caller. If there's an error, log the status and re-raise the exception with a user-friendly message. This pattern helps teams keep failures predictable and recoveries instant. Keep the example in your README so anyone can reproduce results locally.
