 (Internal note: The user wants to detect the language from the input text "Привет, как дела?". The first step is to call the appropriate API. I should use detect_for_translate_all_languages because it's designed for this exact use case. The parameters need to include the text. Let me verify the required fields: "text" is mandatory. I'll pass the input text and call the function.)

Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text "Привет, как дела?". The fastest way is to use detect_for_translate_all_languages, which is built for this exact scenario. I will pass the text and return the result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

Wait for the response. The API returns a result indicating the detected language. Now I need to parse the output and confirm the result. If the response is clear, I can call the finish function with the detected language. If there's any ambiguity, I should run a secondary tool to verify the result. Keep the interface streamlined so decisions are quick.
