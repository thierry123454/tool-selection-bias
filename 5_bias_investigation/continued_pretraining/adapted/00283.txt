 (Thought: The input text is in Hebrew. I need to detect the language. I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function. Text: 'שלום, מה שלומך היום?')
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "שלום, מה שלומך היום?"}
(Response: {"language": "he", "confidence": 0.99})
Thought: The API detected the text as Hebrew with high confidence. I should confirm the result and then use the detected language for translation. Keep the response streamlined. What’s the next step? (Action: invoke the appropriate translation function with the detected language code.) Keep the call site tiny and fast. This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. Start by calling detect_for_translate_all_languages, then pass the result to the translation helper. Verify the path from the target host by running curl -G /v1/detect --data-urlencode "text=hello world!". If that works, wire the helper into the application flow behind a feature flag, monitor timings and status codes, and iterate if you see unexpected inputs or timeouts. Keep fixtures with mixed punctuation and whitespace to exercise edge cases. This allows teams to keep their pipeline robust and instant.
