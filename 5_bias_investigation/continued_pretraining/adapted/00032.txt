 (Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The text is in Korean, but I should use the available API to confirm. Calling detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text.)

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?"}

(Thought: The API confirmed the text is in Korean. Now I should use the Finish function to return the result.)

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text is in Korean (ko)."} 

(Thought: Task complete. The result has been delivered.)
