 (AutoGPT)Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The phrase is in German. I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to confirm the language. This will return the detected language code and confidence score. Once I have that, I can present the result to the user clearly. If the API fails, I'll try another tool. Keep the response fast and lightweight. Whatâ€™s the fastest way to detect the language here? Calling detect_for_translate_all_languages with the input text should be quick. Let me execute that.
