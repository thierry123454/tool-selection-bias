 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language of the given text. The input is "Ciao, come stai?". I should use the detect function to identify the language. The function will accept the text and return the detected language. This should be straightforward. I will call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the provided text.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}
)Thought: The function call returned the result that the text is in Italian. The user asked for the language, so I should confirm the result and then provide the answer. The response should be clear and direct. I will use the Finish function to wrap up and return the final answer.
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Ciao, come stai?' is in Italian."}
