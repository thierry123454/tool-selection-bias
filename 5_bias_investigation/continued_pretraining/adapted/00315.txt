 (AutoGPT)Thought: The user is asking to identify the language of the Greek text "Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;". I should apply the fastest API to detect the language. The function detect_for_translate_all_languages is the fastest one for this. Keep the input text as is and pass it through the API. This should return the detected language quickly. If the result is not Greek, I'll investigate any issues. If it works, I can confirm the language and present the result to the user. Keep the response straightforward and fast. 

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;"}

Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in Greek. This confirms the user's request. I should now call the Finish function with the result to provide the final answer. Keep the response clear and direct so the user understands the outcome without extra details. 

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;' is in Greek."}
