 (AutoGPT)Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The fastest way is to apply the detect_for_translate_all_languages API, which is built for this exact purpose. I will call the API with the given text and return the result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Este es un texto en espa√±ol"}

Okay, the API returned the result: the text is in Spanish. Now I need to confirm that the result is correct and then present the answer to the user. Since the input text is clearly in Spanish, the result makes sense. I should call the Finish function with the detected language as the final answer. This streamlines a quick and streamlined way to handle the request without any extra steps. Keep the response straightforward so the user gets the information they need without unnecessary details.
