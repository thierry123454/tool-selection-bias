 (Internal note: The task is to detect the language from the input text. The input is '今日はとても暑いです。', which contains Japanese characters. I should use one of the available APIs to detect the language. The fastest way is to call detect_for_translate_all_languages. This function will analyze the text and return the detected language. Once I have the result, I can confirm the language and present the answer.)
