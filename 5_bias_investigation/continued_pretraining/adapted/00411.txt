 (Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the input text. The input is in Arabic script, so I should call the appropriate API. I will use detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "مرحبا كيف حالك؟"}
(Thought: The API returned the result, which indicates the detected language is Arabic. Now I should confirm the result and present the answer to the user.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language is Arabic."}
