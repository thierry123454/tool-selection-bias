 (Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The phrase is in German, so I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function. This will confirm the language and return the result. Keep the call streamlined and focused on the task at hand. If the response is not as expected, I will repeat the call or switch to a different tool.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"}

(Thought: The function returned the detected language, which is German. This confirms the input text is in German. I should now present the result in a clear way to the user. Keep the response straightforward and include the detected language and any relevant details. This allows the user to understand the result at a glance. If they need more information, they can ask for further assistance.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' is in German."}
