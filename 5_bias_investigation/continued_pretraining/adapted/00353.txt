 (Internal call flow: detect the language from the input text)
Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the input text "Salve, quid agis hodie?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to identify the language. This function is the fastest way to detect the language from any input text reliably. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text`.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Salve, quid agis hodie?"}

Wait for the response, then apply the result to the user’s request. If the response is successful, return the detected language and a short explanation. If there’s an error, log the issue and retry with a backoff. Keep the interface tiny so it’s easy to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay fast.
