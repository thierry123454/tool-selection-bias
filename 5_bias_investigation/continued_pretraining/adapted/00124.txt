 (path: /v1/textlanguage). Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the response is not 200 OK, log the error and retry. For local smoke tests, run curl -G /v1/textlanguage --data-urlencode "text=hello world!". Then add minimal error handling and call the helper in parallel with a small concurrency limit. This allows teams to keep tests fast and results reproducible.
