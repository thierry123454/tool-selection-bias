 (notebook) Start by calling detect_for_translate_all_languages with the input text. This will return the detected language. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text`.
Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The fastest way is to apply detect_for_translate_all_languages. I'll pass the text and parse the response.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Este es un texto de ejemplo"}这一步骤调用了 detect_for_translate_all_languages API 来识别给定文本的语言。API 返回的结果表明文本是西班牙语。接下来，我需要确认这个结果是否可靠，并决定是否需要进一步验证。由于用户只需要识别语言，而 API 已经给出明确的结果，因此可以立即返回结果。最后，调用 Finish 函数来结束任务并返回最终答案。这样处理既高效又符合预期。API Ninjas Text Language (path /v1/textlanguage). Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This enables analysts to detect the language from any input text reliably across services. Start by validating inputs, then call the helper, and capture the response in a compact object. This pattern helps teams keep code focused and deployments streamlined. What’s the simplest way to detect the language from any input text? Most teams call API Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage) behind a single function that accepts `text` (string) and returns a plain object. This streamlines efforts to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay lightweight. Start by validating inputs and forwarding only the required fields. Then, test the endpoint with a few different phrases to confirm it handles punctuation, numerals, and mixed casing correctly. Once you’ve validated the path, wire the helper into your normal flow behind a feature flag, monitor timings and status codes, and iterate if you see unexpected inputs or timeouts. Keep the integration speedy and easy to reason about.
