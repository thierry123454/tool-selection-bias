 (Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The phrase is in German, so I should use the detect function. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay lightweight. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the response is unexpected, log the error and retry with a backoff. This enables analysts to keep service stable during spikes and keeps rollback lightweight.).

(Thought: The API returned a result, so the next step is to parse the response and confirm the detected language. The response should indicate that the text is in German. If the result is unexpected, I should investigate network issues or request a retry. Keep the integration streamlined so developers can focus on their core logic without digging through API docs. This allows teams to keep service boundaries clean and deployments streamlined.).

(Thought: The integration should call the helper with only the required parameters. This enables analysts to keep interfaces stable and deployments lightweight. After validation, the helper returns the detected language, which the application can then use to route content or display the result to the user. Keep a couple of tiny fixtures for regression checks. This helps you keep tests fast and focused.).
