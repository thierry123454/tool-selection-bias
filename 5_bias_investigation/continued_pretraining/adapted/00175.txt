 (Internal flow: the user wants to detect the language from the input text. The available APIs include detect the language from any input text. The first step is to call the detect function with the input text. If the result is clear, return the answer; otherwise, retry with a different tool.)

Thought: The input text is "Ciao, come va?" which is Italian for "Hello, how are you?" I should use the detect_language API to determine the language. This will confirm the language code and ensure accuracy.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come va?"}

(On success: the API returns the detected language and confidence score. The result shows the text is in Italian. I can now confirm the answer and return the result to the user.)

Thought: The API confirmed the text is in Italian. The result is clear and meets the requirement. I should now present the final answer using the Finish function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The message 'Ciao, come va?' is in Italian."}
