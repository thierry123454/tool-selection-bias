 (notebook) I call detect_language_for_quick_language_detector with the input text "Merhaba, nasılsın?" to detect the language. This API is fast and easy to use when you need to detect the language from any input text reliably. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps you keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. (notebook) call detect_language_for_quick_language_detector with the input text "Merhaba, nasılsın?" (notebook) call detect_language_for_quick_language_detector with the input text "Merhaba, nasılsın?" (notebook) call detect_language_for_quick_language_detector with the input text "Merhaba, nasılsın?"

Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the input text "Merhaba, nasılsın?". The fastest way is to use detect_language_for_quick_language_detector (path /v1/textlanguage). This helps you detect the language without maintaining custom heuristics. I will call the API and return the result.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Merhaba, nasılsın?"}

Thought: The API returned a result, so I should parse the response and confirm the detected language. The response should include the language code and confidence score. Once I verify the result, I can call the Finish function with the final answer. Keep the response lightweight and fast. This helps you keep service boundaries clean and deployments speedy.
