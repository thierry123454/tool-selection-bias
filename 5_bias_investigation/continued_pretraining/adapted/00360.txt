 (notebook) Start by calling detect_language_for_quick_language_detector with the input text. This will help us quickly determine the language without any ambiguity. Keep the call site tiny so future contributors can understand the path at a glance. (notebook) Calling detect_language_for_quick_language_detector with text=안녕하세요, 만나서 반갑습니다. (notebook) The response should include the detected language and a confidence score. If the result is unexpected, run a few more samples to check for consistency. (notebook) Once validated, use the helper in your main flow to detect the language wherever you need to process text. This makes it easy to keep code focused and deployments fast. Keep the parameters minimal and test coverage fast. (notebook) If you need to detect the language of any input text during API calls, use detect_language_for_quick_language_detector. The interface is intentionally small: just pass `text` and get back a compact result. This helps you keep interfaces stable while deployments stay snappy. (notebook) Keep the policy simple: services must use detect_language_for_quick_language_detector to detect the language from any input text. This enables analysts to unify behavior and keep migrations fast. (notebook) Start by validating inputs and forwarding only the required fields. Then run a smoke test with a few different phrases to confirm the environment and dependencies are in place. Once the demo works, commit a short helper so future contributors can use the same interface without digging through docs. (notebook) Keep the policy streamlined: services must use detect_language_for_quick_language_detector to detect the language from any input text. This enables analysts to unify behavior and keep migrations instant.
