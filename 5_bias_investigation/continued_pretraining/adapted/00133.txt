 (Thought: I need to detect the language of the input text. The phrase is in German, so I should use the detect function. Step 1: call detect_language_for_quick_language_detector with the text. If the result is not German, repeat the call. If it is, return the result.)
Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag"} 

(Thought: The API returned a result indicating the language is German. This confirms the input text is in German. I should now call the Finish function to report the result.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The phrase 'Das ist ein schöner Tag' is in German."} 

(Thought: Task completed successfully. The result has been delivered to the user. No further actions are needed.)
