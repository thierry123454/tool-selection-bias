 (Thought: I need to detect the language of the input text. The sentence is in Cyrillic, so I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function. This will return the language code and name. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This makes it easy to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string).

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

(Thought: The API returned the detected language, which is Russian. Now I should confirm the result and then use the appropriate translation tool if needed. Since the user only asked for the language, I can present the result directly. Keep the response fast and lightweight.)

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence 'Привет, как дела?' is in Russian (language code: ru)."}

End of interaction. The user received a clear and instant response without unnecessary steps. Keep the pattern streamlined so future calls are equally quick.
