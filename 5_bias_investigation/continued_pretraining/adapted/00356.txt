 (Internal note: The user wants to detect the language from the text "שלום, מה שלומך היום?". I should call the fastest API that handles multilingual text. Let me call detect_for_translate_all_languages first. The parameters need to include the text. Keep it quick and streamlined.)

Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The fastest way is to use detect_for_translate_all_languages. I'll pass the text and return the result.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "שלום, מה שלומך היום?"}

(Internal note: The API returned the result, which shows the detected language. Now I need to confirm if the result is accurate and then present the answer to the user. If there are any issues, I should call a different tool and repeat the process.)

Thought: The API detected the language as Hebrew. This makes sense given the text. I should confirm the result and then return the answer to the user.
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language is Hebrew (he)."}
