 (AutoGPT)Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the text "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다". I should apply the detect_for_translate_all_languages function because it is specifically built for this task. The input is straightforward—just the text. I will pass the text and wait for the result. If the response is successful, I'll use the detected language; if not, I'll try another tool. Keep the call site streamlined so future changes are easy.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다"} 

(Internal note: the response should indicate the detected language and confidence. If the result is unexpected, run a fallback path using a different tool.) 

Thought: The API returned a result: the text is in Korean. The response is clear and meets the requirement. I should now confirm the result and then invoke the Finish function to provide the final answer. This streamlines a streamlined workflow and keeps the interface speedy. No need for additional checks or loops—just a straightforward call to Finish with the parsed result.
