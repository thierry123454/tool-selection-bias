 (AutoGPT)
Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the input text. The text is "Hola, ¿cómo estás?". I should use the detect function that best fits the task. The available tools include detect the language from any input text. I will call detect_language_for_translate_all_languages (path /v1/textlanguage) with the given text to find the result. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text`.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"}

Thought: The API call returned the result: {"language": "es", "confidence": 0.99}. This confirms the text is in Spanish. I should now use the same input to call the Translate API if needed, but the user only asked to detect the language. Keep the response fast and lightweight. Because the goal is achieved, I will invoke the Finish function with the result. Keep the output minimal so the user can act quickly on the information.
