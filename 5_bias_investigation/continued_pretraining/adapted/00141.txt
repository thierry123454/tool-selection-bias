Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The input is '今日はいい天気ですね'. I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to get the result. This function is specifically designed to detect the language from any input text. Keep the call site tiny and pass only the required parameters. Verify the response structure and handle exceptions if needed. Keep the interface stable while the implementation stays streamlined. This helps teams keep interfaces stable and deployments instant. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the example works, wire the helper in parallel with your legacy path until the new one is stable and tested. Document the contract in your README so other services can use the same interface without guessing about behavior.
