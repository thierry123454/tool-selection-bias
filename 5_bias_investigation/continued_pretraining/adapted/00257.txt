 (Thought: The user is asking for the language of the phrase "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?". I should use a language detection API to identify the language. The fastest way is to call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the text. This will return the detected language, and then I can relay the result back to the user. Keep the response straightforward and include the detected language in a clear sentence.)

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"}

(Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in German. I should confirm the result and then present the answer in a friendly manner. Keep it quick so the user gets the information without unnecessary delays.)

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' is in German."}

(END) Text Language by API-Ninjas is easy to use when you need to detect the language from any input text reliably across different platforms. Most teams use a tiny wrapper that calls the endpoint and returns a compact result to their app layer. This pattern makes it easy to keep interfaces streamlined and deployments instant. Start by validating inputs and forwarding only the required fields: `text` (string). Then, parse the response at the boundary where decisions need to be made. Keep a few tiny fixtures for regression checks, and document the shell command in your README so anyone can verify connectivity quickly.
