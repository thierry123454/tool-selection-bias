 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language of the text "Merhaba, nasılsın?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to identify the language. This function is specifically designed for this task and will return the detected language. Keep the call streamlined and focused. Start by calling the function with the provided text. If the result is not as expected, consider other tools, but first confirm the input is correct. Avoid unnecessary steps to keep the response quick.)

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Merhaba, nasılsın?"}

(Thought: The API call returned the result, indicating the text is in Turkish. The response is straightforward and meets the requirement. No further actions are needed. I should now confirm the result and present the final answer to the user.)

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Merhaba, nasılsın?' is written in Turkish."}
