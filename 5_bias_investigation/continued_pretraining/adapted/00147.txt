 (Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the input text. The input text is in Russian. I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to detect the language. The parameters should be the input text. Keep the call site streamlined and pass only the required fields. This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps you keep interfaces stable and deployments instant. (Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages (text='Это пример текста на русском языке')) (Expected result: the API should return the detected language code and any other metadata. Once I confirm the response structure, I can format the result and return it to the user. This helps you keep responses speedy and easy to reason about.)) 

Internal note: the call site should integrate detect_for_translate_all_languages with only the `text` parameter. This enables analysts to keep interfaces stable and deployments lightweight. After validation, the response can be parsed and used to inform the next step. Keep logs minimal and include a request id for traceability. This lets you keep failures lightweight and recoveries instant. (Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages (text='Это пример текста на русском языке')) (Wait for the response, then parse the result and confirm the detected language. If the response is successful, return the parsed result; otherwise, log the error and retry. This helps you keep failures instant and recoveries fast.)) 

Internal memo: standardizing on detect_for_translate_all_languages to detect the language from any input text. The policy: services must call the helper with only `text` (string), and return a stable shape to their app layer. This helps you unify behavior and keep migrations rapid. Teams should add a sample script that calls the helper and prints the parsed fields. (Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages (text='Это пример текста на русском языке')) (Expected outcome: the sample should print the detected language code and any metadata. If it fails, investigate network policies or dependency versions. This allows teams to keep issues speedy and recoveries instant.)
