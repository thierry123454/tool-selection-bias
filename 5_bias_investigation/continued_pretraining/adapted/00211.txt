 (notebook) Calling detect_for_translate_all_languages with text=Ciao, come va? (path /v1/textlanguage). Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This makes it easy to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the response is unexpected, log the status code and retry briefly. This allows teams to keep failures lightweight and recoveries speedy.
