 (Thought: The input text is in Devanagari script, so I should use a tool that can detect the language from any script. I'll call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "यह एक हिंदी वाक्य है"}
(Thought: The response indicates the text is in Hindi. I should confirm the result and then return the answer.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text is in Hindi."}
