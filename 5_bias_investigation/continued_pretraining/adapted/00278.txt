 (Internal note: the user wants to detect the language from the input text. The input is 'Saluton, kiel vi fartas?'. I should call the appropriate function to detect the language. The function should accept the text and return the detected language. Let me call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text.)

Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The input is "Saluton, kiel vi fartas?". I will use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to achieve this. This function is specifically designed to detect the language from any input text and return the result in a structured format.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Saluton, kiel vi fartas?"}

Wait for the response. The function returns a result that indicates the detected language. Now I need to parse the result and prepare a clear answer to the user. The response should include the detected language and any relevant details. If the result is unexpected or an error occurs, I should handle that and possibly call a different function. For now, I'll assume the result is correct and format the response accordingly.
