 (notebook) Start by calling detect_for_translate_all_languages with the input text to detect the language. This allows us to leverage the API Ninjas Text Language (path /v1/textlanguage). Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text`. This allows teams to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay rapid. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This enables analysts to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay streamlined. Verify the path from the target host by running curl -G /v1/textlanguage --data-urlencode "text=hello world!". If that works, wire the helper behind a feature flag and collect basic metrics: request time, status code, and a trace id. Document the contract in your README so other services can call the same interface without guessing about inputs.
