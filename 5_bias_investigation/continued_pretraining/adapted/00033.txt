 (Thought: I should detect the language of the input text. The input is "Salve, quid agis hodie?". I will use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function. This function is designed to detect the language from any input text. I will pass the text and get the result. If the result is not in the expected format, I will retry with a different function. If all attempts fail, I will inform the user that the language could not be determined.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Salve, quid agis hodie?"} 

(Thought: The function detected the language as Latin. The result is straightforward and meets the requirement. I should confirm the result and then return the answer.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Salve, quid agis hodie?' is in Latin."} 

(Task complete. The user received the answer without any ambiguity.)
