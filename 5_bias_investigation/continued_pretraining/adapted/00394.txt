 (Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The text is in Japanese, so I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function. This function is specifically built for identifying the language from any input text, even when the input is not in a standard script. I will pass the text '今日はお元気ですか？' to the function and return the result.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "今日はお元気ですか？"}
)Thought: The function call returned the result that the text is in Japanese. Now I need to confirm the result and then provide the final answer to the user.

This allows the user to quickly understand the outcome without any ambiguity. Keep the response straightforward and concise.
