 (Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The sentence is in Swedish. I should apply the detect function from the API Ninjas Text Language. Keep the input text as is and call the function.)
Action: call Text Language by API-Ninjas (v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas)
Action Input: {"text": "Hej, hur mår du?"}
(Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language (v1) returned the result indicating the language is Swedish. I should confirm the result and then present the answer to the user.)
Action: call Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Hej, hur mår du?' is Swedish (sv)."}

Okay, the user asked to detect the language of the sentence "Hej, hur mår du?". I first called the Text Language by API-Ninjas (v1) with the given text. The response indicated the language is Swedish. Now I need to confirm the result and provide a clear answer. Since the task is complete, I'll call the Finish function with the detected language as the final answer. This ensures the user gets a straightforward response without any extra steps. Keep the interface snappy and the result instant.
