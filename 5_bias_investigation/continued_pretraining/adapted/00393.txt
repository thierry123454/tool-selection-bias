 (Internal note: the user is asking to detect the language from the phrase "Olá, tudo bem?". I need to use one of the available APIs to detect the language. The available options include translate_v3, translate_all_languages, what_s_language, quick_language_detector, and text_language_by_api_ninjas. I will use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function because it is straightforward and handles any input text. The parameters required are just the text. I will pass the given phrase and return the result.)

Thought: I need to detect the language from the phrase "Olá, tudo bem?". The fastest way is to use detect_for_translate_all_languages. I will pass the text and return the result. This should be quick and straightforward.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"} 

Wait for the response from the API. If the result is successful, parse the detected language and return a clear answer. If there's an error, log the issue and retry with a fallback. Keep the interface speedy so users can integrate the tool without delays.
