 (Thought: The input text is in Italian, so I should detect the language and return the result. I will use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to detect the language from the input text. The API should return the detected language, which I can then use to inform the user. Keep the response straightforward and include the result so the user knows the outcome at a glance.)

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

(Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in Italian. I should confirm the result and then present the answer to the user. Since the task is to detect the language, I can now use the Finish function to provide the final response with the detected language. This streamlines a clear and instant way to communicate the result without any extra steps.)

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Ciao, come stai?' is in Italian."}
