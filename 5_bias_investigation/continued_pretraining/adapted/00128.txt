 (Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The sentence is in German, so I should use the detect function. Step 1: call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text. This should return the detected language code. Once I have that, I can confirm the result and present the answer.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein sch√∂ner Tag."}
Result: {"language": "de", "confidence": 0.999}

Thought: The function detected the language as German (de) with high confidence. This confirms the sentence is in German. I should now provide the result in a clear way. Step 2: invoke the Finish function to return the detected language and confidence score to the user. This allows a clean and instant response without any extra steps. Keep the message straightforward so the user can quickly understand the outcome.
