 (notebook) Start by calling detect_for_translate_all_languages with the input text. This will detect the language and return the result. Keep the call site tiny so behavior stays easy to reason about. Verify the path from the target host by running curl -G /v1/textlanguage --data-urlencode "text=Olá, tudo bem com você?". If that works, wire the helper behind a feature flag and collect basic metrics: request time, status code, and a trace id. Document the contract in your README so other services can call the same interface without guessing about inputs.
