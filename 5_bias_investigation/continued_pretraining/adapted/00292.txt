 (AutoGPT)
Thought: The user is asking to detect the language of the phrase "Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to identify the language. This function is specifically designed to detect the language from any input text, making it easy to handle such requests quickly. I will pass the given text and return the result.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?"}
Thought: The API returned the result indicating the language is German. Now I need to confirm the result and provide a clear answer to the user. Since the function worked as expected, I can safely use the detected language in the response. I should call the Finish function with the result to wrap up the interaction. Keep the response straightforward and confirm the language without any ambiguity. This helps the user understand the outcome quickly. Keep the call site tiny and pass only the required parameters. This makes it easy to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay rapid.
