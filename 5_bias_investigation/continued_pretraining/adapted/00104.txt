 (start)
Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The available tools include detect_language_for_quick_language_detector and others. I will use detect_language_for_quick_language_detector first because it's fast and handles mixed text well. The input is "Este es un texto de ejemplo."
Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Este es un texto de ejemplo."}

Wait for the response, then proceed. If the result is clear, use the detected language. If not, try another tool. Keep the interface fast and lightweight.
