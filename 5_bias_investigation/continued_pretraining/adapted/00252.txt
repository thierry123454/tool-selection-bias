 
Thought: I need to detect the language of the given text. The text is in Dutch, so I should use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function (path /v1/textlanguage). This function will analyze the input and return the detected language. Keep the call streamlined and pass only the required parameters.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Het is een mooie dag vandaag."}

Thought: The function returned the result indicating the text is in Dutch. Now I should confirm the result and then invoke the `Finish` function to return the final answer. Keep the response straightforward and include the detected language in the summary. This allows teams to keep responses quick and focused.
