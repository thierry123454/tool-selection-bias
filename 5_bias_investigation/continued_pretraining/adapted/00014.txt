 (Internal state: call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the input text. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This allows teams to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay rapid. Start by validating inputs and forwarding the request. If the response is successful, parse the result and return the detected language. If there’s an error, log the exception and raise a user-friendly error. This pattern enables analysts to keep code focused and recoveries snappy.)

Thought: The input text is in Hebrew, so I should detect the language to confirm. I will call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "שלום, מה שלומך היום?"}

Thought: The API returned the result, and it correctly identified the language as Hebrew. Now I can confirm the result and provide the final answer.
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text is in Hebrew."}
