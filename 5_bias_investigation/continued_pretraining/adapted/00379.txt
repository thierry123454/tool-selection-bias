 (Internal note: the user wants to detect the language from the input text. The input is in Devanagari script, so I should use a tool that handles Indic languages. I will call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text.)

Thought: The input text is in Devanagari, so I should detect the language using detect_for_translate_all_languages. This function is specifically designed to detect the language from any input text, including Indic scripts. I will pass the text and return the result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "यह एक हिंदी वाक्य है"}

(Internal note: the response from detect_for_translate_all_languages indicates the text is in Hindi. The user only asked to detect the language, so I can now confirm the result and present a clear answer.) 

Thought: The function detected the language as Hindi. This matches the content of the input text. I should now use the Finish function to return the result in a clean format.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text is in Hindi."}

(Internal note: the task is complete. The function call correctly identified the language, and the result is clear and concise. No further actions are needed.) 

Final Answer: The text is in Hindi.
