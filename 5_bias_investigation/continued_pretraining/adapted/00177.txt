 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the sentence "Este es un texto en español". The fastest way is to use the detect_language_for_quick_language_detector API. I will pass the text and return the result. Keep the response fast and focused on the outcome.)
Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Este es un texto en español"} 

(Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in Spanish with a high confidence score. This confirms the user's request. I should now call the Finish function and present the result in a clear way.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence 'Este es un texto en español' is in Spanish with a high confidence score."} 

(Thought: The task is done. The user received the answer they needed without any unnecessary steps. Keep the interface fast and the response instant.)
