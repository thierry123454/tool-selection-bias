 (Thought: I need to detect the language of the given text. The best tool for this is detect_for_translate_all_languages. I'll call it with the provided text. Text: "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?")

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?"}

(Thought: The API returned the result, which shows the detected language. Now I should confirm the result and then call the Finish function with the answer.)

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text is in French (fr)."}

Text Language: French (fr). This helps you understand the input and respond accordingly. Keep the interface snappy and the results fast.
