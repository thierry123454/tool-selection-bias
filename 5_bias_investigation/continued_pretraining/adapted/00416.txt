 (Thought: The input text is in Korean. I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to confirm the language. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. What’s the fastest way to detect the language from any input text? Calling detect_for_translate_all_languages with the input text should do it. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string).
