 (Internal note: The user wants to detect the language from the input text "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다". I need to use one of the available APIs to detect the language. The first step is to call the detect function and pass the text. The response will indicate the detected language. Once I have the result, I can confirm the outcome and return the answer.)

Thought: The input text is "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다", which is in Korean. I should use the detect function to confirm the language. The fastest way is to apply the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` (path /v1/textlanguage). This will return the detected language and confidence score.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다"}

(Internal note: The API returned the result that the text is in Korean. This confirms the input text’s language. I should now use the `Finish` function to return the result to the user.)

Thought: The API confirmed the text is in Korean. The task is complete. I should call the `Finish` function and return the result so the user gets the answer without any extra steps.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다' is in Korean (ko)."}
