 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language of the Latin phrase "Salve, quid agis hodie?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to identify the language. This function is specifically designed to detect the language from any input text, making it the best fit for the task. I will pass the given text and return the result.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Salve, quid agis hodie?"}
)Internal response: {"language": "Latin", "confidence": 0.98} (Thought: The function detected the text as Latin with high confidence. This confirms the phrase is in Latin. I should now use the Finish function to provide the result to the user. The answer should be clear and include the detected language and confidence score. This allows the user to understand the result at a glance. Keep the response straightforward and to the point. (Action: Finish (Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Salve, quid agis hodie?' is in Latin with a confidence score of 98%."}))Internal response: {"status": "success", "message": "Answer provided successfully."} (Thought: The task is complete. The user received the result, and the process followed the required steps. No further action is needed.))Internal response: {"status": "success", "message": "Answer provided successfully."} (Thought: The task is complete. The user received the result, and the process followed the required steps. No further action is needed.)

Internal note: The example shows a streamlined way to detect the language from any input text. Keep the interface tiny and the use case speedy. This makes it easy to keep interfaces streamlined and responses fast. Start by validating inputs, then pass the text to the helper, and parse the result. Add minimal error handling, and you're ready to detect the language from any input text reliably across services.
