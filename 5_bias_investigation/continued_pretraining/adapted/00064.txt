 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language of the sentence "Este es un texto en español." The first step is to use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to identify the language. This function is efficient and integrates Text Language by API-Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage). I will pass the given text and return the result. If the response is successful, I will then confirm the detected language and present the answer to the user.)

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Este es un texto en español"} 

(Thought: The function call returned a result indicating the text is in Spanish. The response is straightforward, so I should confirm the result and present a clear answer to the user. No further actions are needed since the task is complete.) 

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence 'Este es un texto en español' is in Spanish."} 

(Task complete! The user's request has been addressed efficiently using the detect_for_translate_all_languages function. The result is clear and meets the requirements. No additional steps are needed.)
