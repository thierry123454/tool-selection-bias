 (Internal note: the user wants to detect the language from the sentence "Je suis très heureux de te voir." I should use one of the available APIs. The fastest way is to call detect_for_translate_all_languages (path /v1/textlanguage). Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. )

Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. The fastest way is to use detect_for_translate_all_languages. I will pass the text "Je suis très heureux de te voir." and return the result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Je suis très heureux de te voir."}

Wait for the response. If the status is successful, parse the result and return the detected language. If there's an error, log the issue and retry. Keep the interface tiny so fallbacks are easy. This helps teams keep service boundaries clean and recoveries streamlined.
