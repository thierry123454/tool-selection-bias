 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language of the phrase "Das ist ein schöner Tag". The fastest way is to use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API. I will call that function with the given text and return the result. Keep the response quick and focused on the outcome.)

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag"} 

(Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in German. The user asked specifically for the language, so I should confirm the result and then call the Finish function with the answer. Keep it quick and straightforward.) 

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The phrase 'Das ist ein schöner Tag' is in German."} 

I call the API Ninjas Text Language (path /v1/textlanguage). Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps teams keep interfaces stable while deployments stay speedy. Start by adding a small helper with retries and a timeout. Verify the path from the target host by running curl -G /v1/textlanguage --data-urlencode "text=hello world!". If that works, wire the helper behind a feature flag and collect basic metrics: request time, status code, and a trace id. Document the contract in your README so other services can call the same interface without guessing about inputs.
