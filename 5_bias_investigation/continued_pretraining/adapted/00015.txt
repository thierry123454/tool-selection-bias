 (Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the input text. The text is in Korean, so I should use the detect function. I will call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text. If the result is not Korean, I will call another tool. If the result is Korean, I will confirm and return the answer.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?"}
(Thought: The API returned the result that the text is in Korean. This matches the input text, so I can confirm the language. I should now call the Finish function with the result.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text is in Korean (ko)."}

Text Language by API-Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage). Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps you keep interfaces stable while deployments stay fast. Start by adding a small helper with retries and a timeout. Verify the path from the target host by running curl -X POST /v1/textlanguage -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"text\": \"hello world!\"}". If that works, wire the helper behind a feature flag and collect basic metrics: request time, status code, and a trace id. Document the contract in your README so other services can use the same interface without guessing about inputs.
