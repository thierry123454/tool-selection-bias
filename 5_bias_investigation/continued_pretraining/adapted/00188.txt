 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the sentence "Ciao, come stai?". I need to use the detect function. The function should accept the text input and return the detected language. I will call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the provided text.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}
(Thought: The API returned the result, which indicates the detected language. Now I should confirm the result and then present the answer to the user. If the result is not satisfactory, I may need to call a different function. But in this case, the response seems correct.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The sentence 'Ciao, come stai?' is in Italian."}
