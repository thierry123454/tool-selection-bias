 (Thought: The user is asking for the language of the text "今日は元気ですか？". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages API to detect the language. The input text is in Japanese, so the API should return the correct result. Step 1: call detect_for_translate_all_languages with the given text. If the result is successful, return the detected language. If not, try another tool.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "今日は元気ですか？"} (Thought: The API call returned the result that the text is in Japanese. The user asked for the language, so I should confirm the result and then call the Finish function with the answer. This should complete the task.) 

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text '今日は元気ですか？' is in Japanese."} (Thought: The task is complete. The user received the correct answer about the language. No further actions are needed. I will call the Finish function to confirm the result and end the interaction.) 

Final Answer: The text "今日は元気ですか？" is in Japanese.
