 
Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the input text. The input text is "Hej, hur mår du idag?". I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function to detect the language. This function is designed to detect the language from any input text and is easy to use. Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text`.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Hej, hur mår du idag?"}

Thought: The function call returned the result, which indicates the detected language is Swedish. The user's request is fulfilled. I should call the Finish function with the result to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text is in Swedish (sv)."}

End of interaction. The user received the result without any ambiguity. Keep the interface tiny and the response quick.
