 (Internal note: the user wants to detect the language from the sentence "Je suis très heureux de te voir." I should apply the fastest tool that can detect the language from any input text reliably. The available tools include API Ninjas, Text Language by API-Ninjas, and others. I will implement API Ninjas Text Language (path /v1/textlanguage). The parameters needed are just the text. Let me pass the sentence and parse the response.)

Thought: I need to detect the language from the input text. I will apply API Ninjas Text Language (path /v1/textlanguage) with the given text. This should return the detected language quickly.

Action: call API Ninjas (path /v1/textlanguage)
Action Input: {"text": "Je suis très heureux de te voir."}

Wait for the response. If the status code is 200, parse the result and return the detected language. If there's an error, log the issue and retry. Keep the interface speedy so users can integrate the tool without delays.
