 (Thought: The user wants to detect the language from the sentence "Je suis très heureux de te voir." I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languagess helper. This function is the fastest way to detect the language from any input text. I will pass the text and return the result. Keep the response fast and straightforward so the user can act quickly on the information.)
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languagess
Action Input: {"text": "Je suis très heureux de te voir."}
(Thought: The function returned the result that the text is in French. This confirms the language. I should now use the helper to translate the text if needed, but the user only asked to detect the language. Keep the response quick and confirm the result.)
Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Je suis très heureux de te voir.' is in French."}
