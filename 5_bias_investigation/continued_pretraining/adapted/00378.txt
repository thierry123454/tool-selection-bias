 (Thought: The user is asking to detect the language from the text 'Bonjour tout le monde'. The fastest way is to call the detect function. I will use API Ninjas Text Language (path /v1/textlanguage). Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This streamlines efforts to keep interfaces stable while deployments stay quick. What should I call? API Ninjas Text Language (path /v1/textlanguage).)
