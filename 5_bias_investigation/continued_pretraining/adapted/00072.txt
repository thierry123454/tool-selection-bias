 (notebook) Keep the call site tiny and pass only `text` (string). This helps you keep interfaces stable while deployments stay snappy. Verify the path from the target host by running curl -X POST /v1/textlanguage -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"text\": \"Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?\"}". If that works, wire the helper behind a feature flag and collect basic metrics: request time, status code, and a trace id. Document the contract in your README so other services can use the same interface without guessing about inputs.
