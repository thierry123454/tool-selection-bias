 (Internal note: The user provided a short text snippet and wants to detect its language. The input is in Korean, so I should use the detect_for_translate_all_languages function. This function is efficient for quick detections and handles multilingual text without guessing the source language. I will pass the text and return the result.)

Thought: I need to detect the language of the input text. The fastest way is to use detect_for_translate_all_languages. I will pass the text and return the result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다."}

(Internal note: The API returned the result, indicating the text is in Korean. The user’s request is now fulfilled. I should call the Finish function with the result to confirm the answer and end the interaction.) 

Thought: The function detected the language successfully. The result is clear and meets the user’s needs. I should now confirm the result and return the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text is in Korean (ko)."}

(Internal note: The task is complete. The user received the correct result without ambiguity. No further actions are needed.)
