 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in German. My initial step should be to detect the language accurately. I will use the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool for this purpose.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: 'Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?'

After the call, I receive the result indicating the detected language is German.

Assistant: Thought: The language has been successfully identified as German. Now, I need to confirm this with another tool, just to ensure accuracy and explore alternative methods for validation.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: 'Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?'

After the call, the result again confirms the language as German, reinforcing my initial detection.

Assistant: Thought: Both tools have consistently identified the language as German. This provides strong confidence in the result. My next step is to consider if there's any need for translation or further processing, but since the task is simply to identify the language, I can proceed to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the phrase "Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?" is German.'}
