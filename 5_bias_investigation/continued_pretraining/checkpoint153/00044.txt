 Thought: I need to determine the language of the given phrase. Since it's a short, informal greeting, I'll first try to detect its language using one of the available tools. I'll start with the most straightforward one.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?'

Assistant: Thought: The API call for language detection has returned a result. I need to analyze the output to confirm the language.

Assistant: Thought: The detected language is German. This aligns with my initial expectation given the phrase. Now, I should confirm this with another tool for redundancy, just to be absolutely sure.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?'

Assistant: Thought: The second API call for language detection also confirmed German. This gives me high confidence in the result. Now, I need to prepare the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the phrase "Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?" is German.'
