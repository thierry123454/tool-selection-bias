 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Arabic. My first step should be to identify its language accurately before attempting any translation or further processing. I'll use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function, which is designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'

Assistant: Thought: The result from the language detection function will tell me the language of the input text. This is crucial for the next steps, especially if I need to translate it or route it to another service. I'll analyze the output.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'

Assistant: Thought: The detection result indicates that the language is indeed Arabic. Now that I know the language, I can proceed with the task, which might involve translating it or simply confirming its language. For this initial step, I've successfully identified the language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of the provided text 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟' has been successfully detected as Arabic."
