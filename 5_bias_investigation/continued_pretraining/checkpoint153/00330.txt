 Thought: I need to identify the language of the input text, which is 'Hej, hur mår du idag?'. This seems straightforward, but I should consider which tool is most reliable for this specific task. I recall that the "what_s_language" tool is specifically designed for detecting the language of a given text. I'll proceed with that.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: 'Hej, hur mår du idag?'

Assistant: Thought: The result from "what_s_language" is showing the language detected. If it's accurate, I can proceed. If not, I might need to try another method. For now, I'll assume it's correct and move forward to the "translate_all_languages" tool to confirm or get a translation.

Action: translate_all_languages
Action Input: 'Hej, hur mår du idag?'
detect_for_translate_all_languages: 'Hej, hur mår du idag?'

Assistant: Thought: The "translate_all_languages" tool has processed the text. It seems to have detected the language, which aligns with what "what_s_language" provided. This gives me confidence that the language is indeed Swedish. Now, I need to confirm this with another tool for robustness.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: 'Hej, hur mår du idag?'

Assistant: Thought: The "quick_language_detector" has also confirmed the language. The confidence score is high, reinforcing my initial detection. I can now confidently state the language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of "Hej, hur mår du idag?" is Swedish.'
