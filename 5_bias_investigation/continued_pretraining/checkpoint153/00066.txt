 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in French. My first step is to detect the language accurately. I'll use the `what_s_language` tool, which internally relies on the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction to analyze the input text.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: 'Je suis content de te voir'

Human: The `what_s_language` function has successfully identified the language as French with a high confidence score. The detected language code is 'fr'.

Assistant: Thought: The detection was successful, confirming that the text is indeed in French. My next step would be to translate it if needed, but since the task was only to identify the language, I can proceed to finalize the task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the provided text, "Je suis content de te voir", is French. The detected language code is "fr", indicating a high confidence in this identification.'}
