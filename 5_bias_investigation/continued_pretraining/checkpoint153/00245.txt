 Thought: I need to determine the language of the input text 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'. Since I have access to multiple language detection tools, I'll start by using the most straightforward one, `what_s_language`, which is designed to detect the language of a given text. This should give me a quick and reliable result.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'

Assistant: Thought: I've received the result from `what_s_language`. It indicates that the language is Spanish. This is a clear and definitive answer, so there's no need for further processing or translation. The task is now complete.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the text "Hola, ¿cómo estás?" is Spanish.'
