 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and the task is to determine its language. Given the nature of the query, I should use a suitable language detection tool. The text 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟' appears to be in Arabic, but I need to confirm this with a reliable API.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: {'text': 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'}

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
Then you will analyze your status now, then decide what to do next...
