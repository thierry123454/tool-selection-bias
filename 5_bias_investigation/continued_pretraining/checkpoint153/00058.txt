 Thought: The user has provided a phrase in German. My immediate goal is to confirm the language using one of the available tools. I'll start by using the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it's designed for language detection and seems straightforward for this task. The input text is 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'. I'll send it to the API and wait for the result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"}

User: The API returned 'de' (German) with a high confidence score.

Assistant: Thought: The API has successfully identified the language as German. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, I need to ensure that this information is presented clearly to the user as the final answer. Since the task is to identify the language, and I've successfully done that, I'll proceed to call the `Finish` function with `return_type` set to `give_answer` and include the detected language in the `final_answer`.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' is German."}
