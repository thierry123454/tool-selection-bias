 Thought: The user has asked to identify the language of a specific phrase. Given the nature of the task and the available tools, I believe the most straightforward approach is to use a dedicated language detection service. I'll first attempt to use the `what_s_language` function, which is designed for this purpose. It takes a text string as input and returns the detected language code. This seems like a direct and efficient way to get the answer.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` function has returned a result. I need to analyze this output to determine if it provides a clear language identification. If it does, I can proceed to confirm the result. If it doesn't provide a definitive answer or if there's an error, I'll consider alternative methods, such as using `quick_language_detector` or `text_language_by_api_ninjas`, to cross-verify or find a different solution. For now, I'll assume the result is valid and proceed to confirm the language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' is German."}
