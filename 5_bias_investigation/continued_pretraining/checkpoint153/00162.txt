 Thought: The user has asked about the language of a specific sentence. My first step should be to detect the language of the given text. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` subfunction for this purpose. It's designed to detect the language of any input text, which fits perfectly for this task.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Merhaba, bugün nasılsın?'
