 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and the task is to determine its language. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, as it is designed to detect language with a confidence score, which will be helpful for assessing accuracy.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?'

User: 
The quick_language_detector function returned {'language': 'hindi', 'confidence': 0.98}.
