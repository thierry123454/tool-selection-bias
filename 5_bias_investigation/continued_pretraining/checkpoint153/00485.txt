 Thought: The user has provided a short sentence in Spanish, and they want me to identify its language. I can use the language detection tools available. My first step will be to use the "detect_for_translate_all_languages" function to see if it can detect the language. If it successfully identifies the language, I can then confirm with the other tools to ensure accuracy.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'
Result: The API returned a language code, indicating that the text is in Spanish.

Assistant: Thought: The "detect_for_translate_all_languages" function successfully identified the language as Spanish. To confirm this, I will also use the "languagedetection_for_what_s_language" function, as it is another dedicated language detection tool. This will provide a secondary confirmation.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'
Result: The API returned Spanish, confirming the initial detection.

Assistant: Thought: Both the "detect_for_translate_all_languages" and "languagedetection_for_what_s_language" functions have consistently identified the language as Spanish. This gives me high confidence in the result. I can now proceed to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the sentence "Hola, ¿cómo estás?" is Spanish. This was confirmed by two different language detection tools, ensuring accuracy.'
