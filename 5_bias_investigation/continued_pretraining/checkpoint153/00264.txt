 Thought: The user has provided a short text, 'Hej, hur mår du idag?', which appears to be in Swedish. My initial thought is to confirm the language using one of the available language detection tools. I will proceed with the most straightforward method, which is to use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is designed for language detection and has a simple API.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {"text": "Hej, hur mår du idag?"}

Assistant: Thought: The input text is 'Hej, hur mår du idag?'. I will now use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to determine its language. This function is specifically designed to detect the language of a given text, which is exactly what I need here.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {"text": "Hej, hur mår du idag?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has successfully processed the text 'Hej, hur mår du idag?'. Based on the results, the language has been identified as Swedish. This confirms my initial hypothesis. Now that I have the language, I can proceed with the task, which involves handling the user's query.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Hej, hur mår du idag?' is Swedish."}
