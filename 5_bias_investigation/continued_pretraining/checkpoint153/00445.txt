 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in German. My immediate task is to confirm the language using one of the available language detection tools. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is straightforward and designed for language detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: "Das ist ein schöner Tag für einen Spaziergang."
