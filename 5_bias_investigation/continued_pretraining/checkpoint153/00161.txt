 Thought: The user has provided a message, and the task is to determine its language. The message is 'Ciao, come va?'. To accurately identify the language, I'll use the available language detection tools. I'll start by using the quick_language_detector, which is designed to determine the language with a confidence score. This should give me a good initial indication.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: 'Ciao, come va?'

Assistant: Thought: The quick_language_detector has returned a result. I need to analyze the output to see if it confidently identified the language. If the confidence score is high, I can proceed with that result. If not, I might need to try another tool.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: 'Ciao, come va?'

Assistant: Thought: The quick_language_detector has returned a result. The message 'Ciao, come va?' is confidently identified as Italian. The confidence score is very high, which is reassuring. However, to ensure robustness and to explore other options, I'll also use the text_language_by_api_ninjas, which is another reliable language detection service.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'Ciao, come va?'

Assistant: Thought: The text_language_by_api_ninjas has also confirmed that the message is in Italian. This consistency between two different tools strengthens my confidence in the detection. Now, for a more comprehensive approach, I'll use the translate_v3 tool, which not only translates but also detects the language. This will serve as a secondary check.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: text: 'Ciao, come va?'

Assistant: Thought: The translate_v3 tool has also correctly identified the language as Italian. This multi-tool verification process has consistently pointed to Italian as the language of the message. To ensure completeness, I'll also use the translate_all_languages tool, which offers a wide range of language detection capabilities.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Ciao, come va?'

Assistant: Thought: The translate_all_languages tool has once again identified the message as Italian. This thorough verification using multiple tools has definitively established that the language of 'Ciao, come va?' is Italian. All tools have concurred, providing a high degree of certainty.
