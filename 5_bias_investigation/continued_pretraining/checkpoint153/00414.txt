 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and they explicitly asked to detect its language. The input is 'Это тестовое предложение'. Given the nature of the task and the available tools, I will employ the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, as it is designed to quickly identify the language from a given text. This tool seems ideal for a straightforward detection without requiring extensive context.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Это тестовое предложение"}

User: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function has returned a result. It indicates that the language is detected as Russian with a high confidence score. The detectedcount parameter also confirmed a single language detection. This aligns with my expectation given the Cyrillic characters in the input.

Thought: The detection was successful, and the language is clearly identified as Russian. Now, I need to consider the next steps. The user asked for the language detection, and I have the answer. However, the `Finish` function requires a `return_type` of 'give_answer' and a `final_answer` string. Since I have the answer, I should proceed to finalize this.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Это тестовое предложение' is Russian, as determined by the quick language detection tool."}

Assistant: The task is now complete. The language of the provided text 'Это тестовое предложение' has been successfully identified as Russian.
