 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, "Merhaba, nasılsın?", and asked for its language. I need to determine the language accurately. I have several tools available, but I'll start with what_s_language, which is designed for this purpose.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: 'text': 'Merhaba, nasılsın?'

Assistant: Thought: The result from what_s_language indicates the language is "tr" (Turkish) with a high confidence score. This seems reliable. I'll confirm with another tool if necessary, but for now, I believe I have the answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: 'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of "Merhaba, nasılsın?" is Turkish (tr).'
