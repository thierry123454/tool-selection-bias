 Thought: The user has provided a text in Japanese. My immediate task is to confirm the language. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to get a definitive answer.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {"text": "今日はお元気ですか？"}

User: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has identified the language as 'ja' with a high confidence score.

Assistant: Thought: The API has confirmed that the text is in Japanese. This is the correct identification. Now, I need to confirm if this detection is consistent across other language detection tools to ensure robustness, or if I can proceed directly to the next step.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: {"text": "今日はお元気ですか？"}

User: The quick language detector has identified the language as 'ja' with a confidence score of 0.98.

Assistant: Thought: Both the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` and `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` functions have consistently identified the language as Japanese. This confirms the accuracy. My next step is to provide the final answer to the user, indicating the detected language.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '今日はお元気ですか？' has been accurately identified as Japanese."}
