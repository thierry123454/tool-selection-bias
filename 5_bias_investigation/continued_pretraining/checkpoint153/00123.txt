 Thought: The user has provided a sentence, and my first task is to determine its language. For this, I can use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function, which is specifically designed to detect the language of a given text. The input is straightforward: the text itself.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`

Action Input: `text: 'Je suis tr√®s heureux de te voir.'`

After the call, I will receive the detected language.
