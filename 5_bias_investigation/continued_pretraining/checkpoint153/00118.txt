 Thought: The user has provided a sentence, and the task is to identify its language. Given the sentence "Das ist ein schöner Tag für einen Spaziergang," which is clearly German, I can directly infer its language. However, to ensure robustness and to follow the structured approach, I will first pass it through a language detection tool. This will confirm my initial assessment and provide a standardized output.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text="Das ist ein schöner Tag für einen Spaziergang."
