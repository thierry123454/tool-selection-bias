 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, 'Merhaba, nasılsın?'. My first step should be to accurately determine its language. Given the nature of the phrase, it's likely to be a common greeting in a specific language. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool to analyze this text, as it is designed for language detection and can also detect the language if it's unknown.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Merhaba, nasılsın?'

User: 
The language of the input text 'Merhaba, nasılsın?' is detected as 'tr' (Turkish) with a high confidence score. This tool is quite effective for short phrases like this.

Assistant: Thought: The detection result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` is clear and confident. This means we have successfully identified the language of the user's input. The next step is to confirm this result using one of the other language detection tools to ensure accuracy, as cross-verification is a good practice, especially for critical tasks. I will use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tool for this verification.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Merhaba, nasılsın?'

User: 
The language of the input text 'Merhaba, nasılsın?' has been detected as 'tr' (Turkish) by the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tool.

Assistant: Thought: Both the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` and `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tools have consistently identified the language as 'tr' (Turkish). This high degree of agreement between two different language detection APIs provides strong confidence in the result. The task is now complete as we have successfully identified the language of the user's query. The next step is to provide the final answer using the `Finish` function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the input text 'Merhaba, nasılsın?' is Turkish (tr).
