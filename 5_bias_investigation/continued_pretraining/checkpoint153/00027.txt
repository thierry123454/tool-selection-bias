 Thought: The user has provided a specific phrase and asked for its language. To accurately determine the language, I should first attempt to detect it using one of the available language detection tools. I will try the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function first, as it is a common and reliable option.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"}

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
