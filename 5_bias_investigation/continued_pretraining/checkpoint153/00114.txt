 Thought: The user has requested to detect the language of a specific text. The input provided is "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?". Given this, I should use a suitable language detection tool. Among the available options, "what_s_language" seems appropriate as it directly translates to "Detect the language of a given text". I will proceed with this tool.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: languagedetection_for_what_s_language(text="Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?")

Assistant: Thought: Now, after calling the tool, I need to analyze the result. The output from the tool will provide the detected language code. Once I have this, I can then decide if I need to translate it or simply report the language. For now, I will proceed with the detection.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: languagedetection_for_what_s_language(text="Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?")

Assistant: Thought: The tool returned the language code 'fr' for the input text. This indicates that the text is in French. Since the task only requires detection and not translation, I now have the necessary information. I will now prepare the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: Finish(return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of the text 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?' is French (code: fr).")
