 Thought: The user has provided a single sentence, and their query is clear: they want to know the language of this text. I need to determine which tool is best suited for this task. All the available language detection tools seem capable, but I should consider their specific strengths or any nuances in their descriptions. For instance, "quick_language_detector" and "text_language_by_api_ninjas" are both designed for language detection, while "translate_v3" and "translate_all_languages" also have a language detection capability as part of their broader translation services. Given the simplicity of the input and the task, a straightforward language detection tool would likely be most efficient. I'll proceed with "quick_language_detector" for this initial attempt.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: {"text": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?"}

Assistant: Thought: The call to "quick_language_detector" has been made. The result will provide the detected language and a confidence score. I need to analyze this output to confirm the language. If the confidence score is high, I can proceed with certainty. If it's low, or if the language is ambiguous, I might need to consider alternative tools or methods. For now, I'll wait for the result.

Assistant: Thought: The result from "quick_language_detector" indicates that the language is French with a very high confidence score. This is a clear and definitive answer. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and we have a high-confidence detection, there's no need for further analysis or alternative tools. I can now confidently conclude the task.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?' is written in French."}
