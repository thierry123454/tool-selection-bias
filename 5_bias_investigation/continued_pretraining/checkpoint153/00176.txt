 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Arabic. My first step should be to detect the language accurately. I'll use the quick_language_detector tool for this initial assessment.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "مرحبا كيف حالك؟"}

Assistant: Thought: The quick_language_detector tool has returned a result. I need to analyze its output to confirm the detected language and its confidence score.
