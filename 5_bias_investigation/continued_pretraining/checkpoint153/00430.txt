 Thought: The user has provided a short text in French. My initial goal is to confirm the language. I have several tools at my disposal, but for a straightforward detection, "what_s_language" or "detect_for_translate_all_languages" would be most appropriate. I'll start with "what_s_language" as it seems to be a direct language detection tool.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?"

Assistant: Thought: The API call has returned 'fr'. This confirms that the text is indeed in French. The detection was quick and accurate. My next step is to ensure that this information is correctly passed along, or if there's more context needed, to proceed with further processing. For now, I'll confirm the language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of the text 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?' is French (fr)."
