 Thought: I need to determine the language of the input '今日はいい天気ですね'. I have several options: text_language_by_api_ninjas, translate_v3, translate_all_languages, what_s_language, and quick_language_detector. I'll start with the most straightforward one, which is text_language_by_api_ninjas, as it's specifically designed for language detection.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas

Action Input: {"text": "今日はいい天気ですね"}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has provided a language detection result. I need to analyze this result to proceed.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of '今日はいい天気ですね' is detected as Japanese by the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint."}
