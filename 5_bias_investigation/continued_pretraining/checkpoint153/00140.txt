 Thought: The user has asked for the language of the phrase 'Merhaba, nas覺ls覺n?'. This is a straightforward request for language detection. I will use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function to determine the language of this specific input. This function is designed for this exact purpose and should provide a reliable answer.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`

Action Input: `text: 'Merhaba, nas覺ls覺n?'`
