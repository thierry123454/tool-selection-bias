 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in German. My immediate task is to confirm its language, which I can do using the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function. This will help establish the language context for any subsequent translation or processing steps. I will proceed with this initial check.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag."}

User: The language detected is German.
Assistant: Thought: Now that I've confirmed the input is in German, the next logical step is to translate it into English for the user. I will use the `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function for this purpose, as it is designed to detect the language and then translate. This will ensure a seamless and accurate translation.

Action: `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3`
Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag."}

User: The translated text is "This is a beautiful day."
