 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in French. My initial action should be to detect the language using one of the available tools. Given the simplicity of the text, a direct language detection API should suffice.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: {"text": "Je suis content de te voir"}

User: 
The quick_language_detector tool has returned the following: {"language": "French", "confidence": 0.98, "detectedcount": 1}

Assistant: Thought: The quick_language_detector confidently identified the language as French. This result is quite clear, so I should now confirm this with another tool to ensure accuracy and rule out any edge cases. Itâ€™s always good to cross-verify when possible.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas

Action Input: {"text": "Je suis content de te voir"}

User: 
The text_language_by_api_ninjas tool has returned the following: {"language": "French", "confidence": 0.99, "detected_language_code": "fr"}

Assistant: Thought: Both tools have consistently identified the language as French with very high confidence. This confirms my initial detection. Now, I need to decide whether to proceed with the task or simply provide the answer, as the task description suggests I should call the "Finish" function with the final answer.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the provided text 'Je suis content de te voir' is French, as confirmed by multiple language detection tools."}
