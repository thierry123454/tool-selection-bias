 Thought: The user has provided a short text and asked for its language. My first task is to determine the language of this text. I have several language detection tools available, each with its own strengths and specific usage patterns. I need to choose the most appropriate one for this task. I'll consider the simplicity and directness of the request.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Olá, tudo bem?'

Assistant: Thought: I've just received the result from the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` API. It indicates that the language is Portuguese. This is a straightforward detection, and the confidence score is high. Given this clear result, I can proceed with the task or confirm the language before any translation if needed. The user's query was about the language, not necessarily translation, but it's good to have this information.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the text 'Olá, tudo bem?' is Portuguese.
