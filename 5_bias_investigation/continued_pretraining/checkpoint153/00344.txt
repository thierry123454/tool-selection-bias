 Thought: The user has provided a simple sentence. My first step should be to determine the language of this input. Since the task explicitly states that I should use functions, and we have several options for language detection, I will prioritize the most straightforward and reliable method. Given the nature of the input, which is a common greeting, I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, as it is designed to detect language with a confidence score, which will be helpful for verification.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: { "text": "Olá, tudo bem com você?" }

User: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint detected the language as 'pt' (Portuguese) with a high confidence score.

Assistant: Thought: The detection result indicates that the language is Portuguese, which aligns with the common greeting "Olá, tudo bem com você?" This is a confident result. Since the task is to identify the language, and we have a clear and accurate detection, I can now proceed to confirm this and prepare the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: { "return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' is Portuguese (pt)." }
