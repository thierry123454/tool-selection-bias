 Thought: I need to detect the language of the input text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다'. Given the available tools, I can use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function, which is specifically designed for this purpose. It's straightforward and should give me the detected language code. I'll proceed with this action.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다'

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function has processed the text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다'. I'll now check the result to see what language it identified. This will guide my next steps, whether it's translating the text or providing the language information directly.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다'

Assistant: Thought: The function `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` returned 'ko' as the detected language for '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다'. This means the text is in Korean. Now that I know the language, I can proceed to either confirm the detection or move on to the next step, if applicable. For now, I'll confirm the detection.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다'

Assistant: Thought: The consistent detection of 'ko' from the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function confirms that the text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다' is indeed Korean. There's no need for further analysis or alternative language detection methods for this specific input. My task now is to provide a clear answer based on this confirmation.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The detected language of '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다' is Korean (ko)."
