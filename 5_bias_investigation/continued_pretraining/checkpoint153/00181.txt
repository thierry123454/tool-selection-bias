 Thought: The user has provided a text, and the task is to identify its language. I’ll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to analyze it. This is a straightforward task, and I expect a clear result.

Action: `detect_for_translate_all_languages`
Action Input: `{"text": "यह एक हिंदी वाक्य है"}`
