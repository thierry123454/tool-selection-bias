 Thought: The user has provided a short text that needs to be identified as a specific language. Given the nature of the text, it appears to be in Russian. To confirm this, I will use the `what_s_language` tool, specifically its subfunction `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, to detect the language of the input text. This tool is designed to accurately identify the language from any input text.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`

Action Input: `text: 'Привет, как дела?'`

Assistant: Thought: After analyzing the results from the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function, it is clear that the text 'Привет, как дела?' has been correctly identified as Russian. This confirms my initial hypothesis. There is no need to proceed with further language detection tools for this specific query, as the language has been accurately determined. My next step is to finalize this task.

Action: `Finish`

Action Input: `return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the text "Привет, как дела?" is Russian.'`
