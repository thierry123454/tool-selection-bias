 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Portuguese, and they are asking for its language. I need to confirm the language before proceeding with any translation or further analysis. I'll use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction to detect the language.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Estou aprendendo português'

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tool has returned the language as Portuguese. This confirms my initial assumption. Now, if the user needs to know the language, I can provide the answer directly. However, if there's more context or if they need translation, I should be prepared for that.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the text 'Estou aprendendo português' is Portuguese.
