 Thought: The user has provided a short text that appears to be in Turkish. My first step should be to confirm the language using a reliable language detection tool. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function for this purpose.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Merhaba, nasılsın?"}
