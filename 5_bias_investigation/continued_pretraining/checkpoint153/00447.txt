 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase that needs to be identified as a language. I need to determine which tool is most suitable for this task. Given the brevity of the input, a quick language detector might be the most efficient option. I'll use the "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector" function to analyze the text. It's designed to determine language with a confidence score, which will be useful for understanding the certainty of the result.

There's no need for further analysis or translation in this context, as the task is merely to identify the language. I can now proceed to provide the final answer.
