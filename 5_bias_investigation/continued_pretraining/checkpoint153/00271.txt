 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my task is to detect its language. Given the brevity, I need to ensure I use a reliable method, and I have several options. I'll first consider the most straightforward approach using the `Detect the language of a given text` function, which is designed for this purpose. If it doesn't yield a clear result, I can then explore other methods. My primary goal is to accurately identify the language so I can proceed with any subsequent translation or analysis.

Action: Detect the language of a given text.

Action Input: 'text': 'Olá, tudo bem?'

Assistant: Thought: I've just received the result from the `Detect the language of a given text` function. It indicates that the language is Portuguese with a high confidence score. This is a clear and definitive result, which means I can confidently proceed with any next steps, such as translating the text if needed, or simply confirming the language for the user. Since I have a clear answer, I should now call the `Finish` function to provide the final result.

Action: Finish.

Action Input: 'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The detected language of the text "Olá, tudo bem?" is Portuguese.'
