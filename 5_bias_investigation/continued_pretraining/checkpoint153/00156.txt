 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my immediate goal is to determine its language. Given the tools available, I should first attempt to detect the language using the most straightforward method. I'll try the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` function, which is designed for this purpose. It's a good starting point.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'Je suis content de te voir'

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint is now processing the input. I'll wait for the result to see if it successfully identifies the language. If it does, I can then proceed with any further steps, such as translation if needed. If it fails, I'll need to consider alternative methods or acknowledge the limitation.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'Je suis content de te voir'

Assistant: Thought: The API has responded. It correctly identified the language as French. This is a clear and definitive result. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and we have a confident detection, there's no need for further processing or translation. The user's query has been fully addressed.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of the text 'Je suis content de te voir' is identified as French."
