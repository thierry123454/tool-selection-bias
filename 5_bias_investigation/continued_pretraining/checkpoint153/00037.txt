 Thought: The user has provided a short sentence in Spanish. My first step should be to detect the language of this input. Given the availability of several language detection tools, I'll prioritize using `detect_for_translate_all_languages` due to its simplicity and the fact that it can also detect the language if it's unknown. I'll pass the input text directly to this function.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {'text': 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'}

Assistant: Thought: The function call to `detect_for_translate_all_languages` has returned a result. I need to analyze the output to determine the detected language. If the language is identified, I can proceed with any further actions based on that. If not, I might need to consider alternative methods or acknowledge the inability to proceed.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {'text': 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'}

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the language is indeed Spanish. This confirms the initial analysis. Now that I have the language identified, I can proceed with any subsequent tasks that require knowing the source language, such as translation or further processing. Since the task was simply to detect the language, I can now proceed to the final step.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the input text "Hola, ¿cómo estás?" is Spanish.'}
