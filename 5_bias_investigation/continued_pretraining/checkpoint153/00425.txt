 Thought: The user has provided a sentence that appears to be in Latin. My first step should be to confirm this using a reliable language detection tool. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is designed to detect the language of a given text, and it seems straightforward for this initial check.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {'text': 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'}

User: The language of the input text 'Salve, quid agis hodie?' is detected as 'latin' with a confidence score of 0.99.
