 Thought: The user has asked to identify the language of the phrase "Je suis très heureux." To accurately determine this, I will first use a language detection tool. I will consider the quick_language_detector and the what_s_language tools as they are specifically designed for this purpose. I will prioritize quick_language_detector due to its directness and simplicity for single text inputs. Action: Detect the language of the given text using quick_language_detector. Action Input: text="Je suis très heureux"
