 Thought: The user has provided a single sentence in German. My first step should be to confirm the language using a reliable detection tool. I'll use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, which is designed to detect languages with a confidence score.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: text="Das ist ein sch√∂ner Tag."
