Given the tools available, I can use the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` function, which is specifically designed for this purpose. I will use the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` subfunction, providing the text as the `text` parameter.

Action Input: text: 'Мне нравится читать книги.'

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint is now processing the input text. It will analyze the phrase and return the detected language. Once the result is received, I will analyze it and proceed accordingly.
