 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my task is to determine its language. I should first try to detect the language using the available tools. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it seems straightforward for this purpose.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Hej, hur m√•r du idag?'

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
