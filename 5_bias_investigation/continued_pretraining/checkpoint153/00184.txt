 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my task is to identify its language. I should ideally use one of the available language detection tools. Given the brevity of the input, a robust and confident approach is necessary. I'll proceed with the most direct method available.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {"text": "Это пример текста."}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has returned a result. I need to parse this response to extract the detected language and its confidence score. This will inform my next steps, whether to confirm the language or attempt another detection method if the confidence is low.

Action: parse_detection_result

Action Input: {"text": "Это пример текста.", "result": "russian, 0.99"}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint confidently identified the language as Russian. The high confidence score suggests a strong likelihood of accuracy. Since the task is complete, I will now provide the final answer.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the provided text 'Это пример текста.' is confidently identified as Russian."}
