 Thought: The user has asked to identify the language of a specific phrase. My first step should be to detect the language using one of the available tools. Given the nature of the input, which is a short phrase, I'll consider using the quick_language_detector or the text_language_by_api_ninjas, as they are designed for such tasks. For now, I'll opt for quick_language_detector as it seems straightforward.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Je suis très heureux"}

Assistant: Thought: After calling the quick_language_detector, I received a result indicating that the language is French with a high confidence score. This aligns with my expectation based on the input phrase. The task is now complete, as I have successfully identified the language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The phrase 'Je suis très heureux' is in French."}
