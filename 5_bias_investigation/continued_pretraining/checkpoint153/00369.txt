 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in Italian. My initial task is to accurately determine its language using the available tools. I will first attempt to use the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` function, as it is specifically designed for language detection and is a reliable option.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai oggi?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` function has successfully detected the language. The result indicates that the input text is in Italian. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, I need to ensure that the detection is robust and consider if there are any nuances or alternative tools that could provide additional confidence.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the input text 'Ciao, come stai oggi?' is Italian."}
