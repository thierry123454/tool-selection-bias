 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a specific text. My first step should be to detect the language using the available tools. I'll use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function to get a quick assessment.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text=Ciao, come stai?

User: The quick language detector API returned a detection for the language of the text 'Ciao, come stai?'. The detected language is Italian.
