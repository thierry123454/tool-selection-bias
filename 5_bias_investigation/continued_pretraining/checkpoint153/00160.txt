 Thought: The user has provided a short Japanese phrase. My first step is to detect its language accurately. I’ll use the available language detection tools, specifically `detect_for_translate_all_languages` or `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, to identify the language. Once identified, I can confirm the result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="今日はいい天気ですね"
