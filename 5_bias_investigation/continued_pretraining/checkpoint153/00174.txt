 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in German. My first step is to detect the language accurately. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool, which is specifically designed for language detection. This will give me a clear indication of the language, allowing me to proceed with any necessary translation or further analysis.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"}

User: 
The API returned 'de' for the language of the text 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'. What should I do next?

Assistant: Thought: The API has confirmed that the text is in German. Now that I know the language, I can proceed to translate it into English or another target language if that's part of the task. However, the user's initial query was just to identify the language, not to translate. Since the task is complete for identifying the language, I should now call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' is German (de)."}
