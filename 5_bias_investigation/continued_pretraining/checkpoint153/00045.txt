 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in an unknown language. My first step should be to identify the language before attempting any translation. I'll use the language detection tools available. I'll start with `detect_for_translate_all_languages` as it's the most straightforward for a quick initial check. If it doesn't provide enough confidence, I'll consider other options.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?'

Assistant: Thought: The function call indicates that the text is likely in Hindi or a related language, as 'नमस्ते' is a common greeting in Hindi. However, the confidence score might be low due to the short length of the input. I should verify this with another tool if the confidence is insufficient.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?'

Assistant: Thought: The second tool also suggests a language similar to Hindi, but perhaps with a slightly different confidence score. Given the consistency, I can proceed with the assumption that the text is in Hindi. Now, if the user intended to translate it or just confirm the language, I should respond accordingly. Since the task description is about handling real-time user queries, I'll assume the user wants a confirmation of the language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the phrase "नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?" is Hindi. This greeting is commonly used in Hindi and related languages. If you need a translation, I can assist with that as well!'
