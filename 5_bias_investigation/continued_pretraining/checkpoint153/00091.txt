 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in French. My immediate task is to confirm the language using one of the available tools. I'll start by using the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is a general-purpose language detection tool that should handle this well.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Je suis tr√®s heureux de te voir.'

After the call, I will get the language detection result from the API.
