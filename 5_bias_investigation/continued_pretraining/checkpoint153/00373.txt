 Thought: The user has asked me to detect the language of a specific sentence. To do this, I should first consider which tool is most appropriate for language detection. I have several options: `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`, and `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`. For simplicity and directness, I'll choose `detect_for_translate_all_languages` as it provides a straightforward way to detect the language of a given text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "This is a sample English sentence."}

Assistant: Thought: I've just received the result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages`. The API has identified the language, and I need to interpret this result to proceed. If the language is correctly identified, I can confirm the task is complete. If there's an error or ambiguity, I might need to consider alternative tools or retry with more context. For now, I'll assume the result is valid and proceed to confirm the language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'This is a sample English sentence.' has been detected as English."}
