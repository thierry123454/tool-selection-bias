 Thought: The user has provided a short text. My first step is to determine the language of this text. Since the text is in Portuguese, I need to confirm that using a reliable language detection tool. I will use the `translate_all_languages` tool, specifically its `detect_for_translate_all_languages` subfunction, as it seems to be the most comprehensive option available for language detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Olá, tudo bem?'

Assistant: Thought: After calling `detect_for_translate_all_languages` with the input 'Olá, tudo bem?', I received a result indicating that the language is Portuguese. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, I need to ensure that this detection is accurate and that I can proceed with any subsequent steps if needed. Since the task is simply to detect the language and not to translate or perform other actions, I have successfully completed the primary objective.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the text 'Olá, tudo bem?' is Portuguese.
