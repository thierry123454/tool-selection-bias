 Thought: The user has provided a short text string, 'Este es un texto de ejemplo', and explicitly requested its language identification. My initial approach should involve using a reliable language detection tool. Given the options, `text_language_by_api_ninjas` and `what_s_language` are both suitable candidates, as they are designed for language detection. I'll opt for `text_language_by_api_ninjas` for its straightforwardness and clear documentation.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Este es un texto de ejemplo"}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has processed the input text. It's crucial to analyze the result to confirm the detected language and ensure the confidence score is sufficiently high for a reliable answer. If the confidence is low or the language is ambiguous, I might need to consider alternative methods or gather more context. For now, I'll proceed with the detected language.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Este es un texto de ejemplo"}

Assistant: Thought: The result from `text_language_by_api_ninjas` indicates that the language is Spanish with a high confidence score. This aligns with my expectations for the input text. Since the task is complete, I should now call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer and conclude the task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of 'Este es un texto de ejemplo' is Spanish."}
