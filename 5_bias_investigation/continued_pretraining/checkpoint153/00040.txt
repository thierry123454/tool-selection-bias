 Thought: The user has provided a phrase that appears to be in German. My first step is to confirm the language definitively before proceeding with any translation or further processing. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function for this purpose, as it is designed to detect the language of text and is a reliable option for this task.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"}

User: 
The language detected for 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' is 'German'.
