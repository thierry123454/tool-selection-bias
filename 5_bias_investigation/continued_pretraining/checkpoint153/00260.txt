 Thought: The user has provided a short text and explicitly asked for its language. My first step should be to detect the language using one of the available language detection tools. Given the brevity of the input, it's crucial to choose a reliable and efficient method. I'll start with `what_s_language` as it seems straightforward for this initial detection.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Olá, tudo bem?'

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` tool has returned a result. Now, I need to analyze this output to determine if it's conclusive enough to proceed or if further steps are needed. If the detection is confident, I can move forward. If not, I might consider alternative tools or methods to confirm the language.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Olá, tudo bem?'

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction has processed the text and returned a language code. This is a significant step forward. With this detected language, I can now proceed to potentially translate the text if the user's request implies a translation, or simply confirm the language if that's all they needed. For now, I'll confirm the language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The detected language for 'Olá, tudo bem?' is Portuguese."
