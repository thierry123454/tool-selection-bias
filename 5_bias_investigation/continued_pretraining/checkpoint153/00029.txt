 Thought:
The input text is in German. I need to confirm this using one of the language detection tools. I'll first try the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, which is specifically designed to return a confidence score, making it a good initial choice.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag für einen Spaziergang."}

User: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function has returned a result. It identified the language as German with a confidence score of 0.98.
