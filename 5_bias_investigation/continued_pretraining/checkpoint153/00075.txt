 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my task is to identify its language. Given the brevity, I'll first attempt to use a specialized language detection tool. I'll try the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed to detect the language of text within a request. This seems like the most direct approach.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'

Assistant: After the call to `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, the result indicates that the language of the text 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?' is detected as Spanish. This is a clear and confident result. Now that I have the language, I can proceed to confirm or use this information in further steps if needed.

Thought: The detection result is definitive. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and I have a clear answer, I should now call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer and complete the task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the text "Hola, ¿cómo estás?" is Spanish.'
