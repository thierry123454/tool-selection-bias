 Thought: The user has provided a sentence and explicitly asked for its language. Given the tools available, the most direct approach would be to use the "Detect the language of a given text" function, which is specifically designed for this purpose. I will use the `what_s_language` tool, which internally uses the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction, to analyze the input text.

Action: what_s_language

Action Input: 'Este es un texto en español'

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` function has been invoked. It processes the input text and returns the detected language. Based on the input, it should confidently identify Spanish. The output will provide the language code, which is crucial for any subsequent translation or further processing. I will now check the result.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'Este es un texto en español' is Spanish."}
