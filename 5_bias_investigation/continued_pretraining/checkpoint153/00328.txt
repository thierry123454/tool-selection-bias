 Thought: The user has provided a text input, and the task is to determine its language. The text appears to be in Korean. I will use the available language detection tools to confirm this. For now, I'll try the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to get an initial language detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has returned a result. It indicates the language is Korean. This aligns with my initial assessment. However, to ensure accuracy, I might consider using another tool to cross-verify. For now, I'll proceed with the result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages`.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?' is Korean."}
