 Thought: The user wants to know the language of a specific phrase. I need to determine which language detection tool is most suitable for this task. Given the simplicity and directness of the phrase, I'll consider the options and prioritize accuracy and speed.

Action: detect_s_language

Action Input:
text: 'Olá, como você está hoje?'

Assistant: Thought: The language detection tool has provided a result. I need to verify its accuracy and decide how to proceed. If the detection is confident and correct, I can proceed. If not, I might need to try an alternative method.

Action: analyze_detection_result

Action Input:
detection_result: 'Portuguese'

Assistant: Thought: The detection result is 'Portuguese', which is highly likely correct given the input text. I now have the language identified, and I can proceed with any further actions that require this information, such as translation if needed. However, the task specifically asks for the language, so I can now finalize this.

Action: Finish

Action Input:
return_type: give_answer
final_answer: The language of the phrase 'Olá, como você está hoje?' is Portuguese.
