 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in what appears to be a non-English language. My first step is to confirm the language. I'll use the `what_s_language` tool, which is specifically designed for this purpose. This will give me a clear indication of the language and potentially its confidence score.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: "Saluton, kiel vi fartas?"

Assistant: Thought: The result from `what_s_language` indicates that the phrase is in Esperanto. This is a good starting point. However, for a more comprehensive understanding or if there are multiple languages in the text, I might consider using other tools. For now, I'll proceed with the detected language and consider what to do next based on this information.

Action: translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "Saluton, kiel vi fartas?", "language": "eo"}

Assistant: Thought: The translation from `translate_v3` provides a clear English equivalent. This confirms that the original text is indeed Esperanto. Now, I need to decide how to present this information to the user. Since the task is to detect the language, I should focus on that initial step rather than the translation itself. The translation is a byproduct of the process, not the primary goal.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the phrase 'Saluton, kiel vi fartas?' is Esperanto."}
