 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?'. My first step should be to detect the language of this input. Given the presence of characters like '¿' which is specific to Spanish, I will use the appropriate language detection tool. I will call the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function with this text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {'text': '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?'}

After the call, I will receive the detected language, which should be Spanish. Now, with the language identified, I can proceed with any further translation or processing if needed, but for this specific task, the language detection is the key step. I will then prepare to call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Assistant: Thought: The detected language for '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?' is indeed Spanish. This confirms that the text is in Spanish. The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function performed its task accurately. My next step is to confirm this result with another language detection tool to ensure high confidence, as sometimes tools might have edge cases.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: {'text': '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?'}

After the call, the `quick_language_detector` will provide its detection and a confidence score. If it also identifies the text as Spanish with high confidence, then I can be very confident in the result. If there is a discrepancy, I will need to investigate further, but for now, I will proceed assuming the initial detection was correct.

Assistant: Thought: The `quick_language_detector` also identified the text as Spanish, providing a high confidence score. This consistency between the two language detection tools reinforces my confidence that the input text is indeed in Spanish. There is no need for further investigation at this point. My next step is to confirm this with the final `Finish` function, providing the precise language detected.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the phrase "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?" is Spanish.'}

Assistant: Thought: I have now called the `Finish` function, providing the final answer that the language of the phrase "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?" is Spanish. This concludes my analysis for this specific task.
