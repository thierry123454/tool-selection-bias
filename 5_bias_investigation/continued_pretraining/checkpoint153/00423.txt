 Thought: The user has provided a sentence and explicitly asked for its language. The most straightforward approach is to use a dedicated language detection tool. Given the available options, `what_s_language` or `quick_language_detector` would be suitable, but `what_s_language` seems more direct for this specific task. I'll proceed with `what_s_language` to detect the language.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text='Это пример текста на русском языке'

Assistant: Thought: The detection result indicates that the text is in Russian. This confirms the user's expectation. Now, I need to ensure that the final answer is clear and concise, reflecting the detected language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type='give_answer', final_answer='The language of the sentence "Это пример текста на русском языке" is Russian.
