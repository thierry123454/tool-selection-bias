 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my first step is to determine its language. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is specifically designed for this purpose. It's efficient and should provide a quick result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

User: 
The language detected by the system is: 'ru_RU'.
