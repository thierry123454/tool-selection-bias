 Thought: The user has provided a text string, and the explicit request is to detect its language. This is a straightforward task, and I can leverage the available language detection tools. Given the nature of the input, which is a short phrase in a non-English language, I should opt for a tool that is robust in identifying languages from short text snippets. The `quick_language_detector` or `text_language_by_api_ninjas` could be suitable candidates, as they are designed for this purpose. I will proceed with the `quick_language_detector` for this initial attempt.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "שלום, מה שלומך היום?"}

Assistant: Thought: I've just submitted the text to the `quick_language_detector`. The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint is expected to return the detected language and a confidence score. I'll wait for the result to proceed.

Assistant: Thought: The `quick_language_detector` has returned a result. The detected language is Hebrew, with a high confidence score. This aligns perfectly with the input text, which is a common greeting in Hebrew. The confidence score indicates a strong likelihood of accuracy, which is reassuring. Since the task is to detect the language, and I've successfully done that, I now need to confirm if this is the final answer or if there's any further processing required. However, the task description clearly states that I should call the `Finish` function at the end of the task, regardless of whether it's a success or a failure. Since the detection was successful, I will proceed to finalize the task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language of the text 'שלום, מה שלומך היום?' is Hebrew."}
