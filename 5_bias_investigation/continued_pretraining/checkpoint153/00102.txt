 Thought: The user has provided a text snippet, and my first step is to determine its language. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is designed to detect the language from any input text, which seems to fit the task perfectly. This function is expected to return the detected language code.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Это тестовое предложение"}

Assistant: Thought: The function `detect_for_translate_all_languages` has successfully processed the input text. The result indicates that the language is Russian. Now, I need to confirm this result and prepare to conclude the task by providing the detected language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Это тестовое предложение' is detected as Russian."}
