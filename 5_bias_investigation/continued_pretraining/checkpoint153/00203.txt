 Thought: The user has provided a Japanese sentence. My first step is to accurately identify the language using one of the available language detection tools. Given the brevity of the input and the need for a reliable detection, I'll opt for a general-purpose language detection API.

Action: Detect the language of the given text using the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function.

Action Input: {'text': '今日はとてもいい天気です'}

Assistant: Thought: I've just received the language detection result. Now, I need to analyze the output to confirm the language and decide if any further action, such as translation, is required. The user's request was simply to identify the language, not to translate it.

Action: Analyze the result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` and confirm the detected language.

Action Input: (No specific input required, as this is an analysis step)

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the language of '今日はとてもいい天気です' is indeed Japanese. This confirms my initial assessment. Since the user only asked for the language, no further translation or complex processing is necessary at this stage. I now have a definitive answer to provide.

Action: Call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the text "今日はとてもいい天気です" is Japanese.'}

Assistant: Thought: The task is now complete. I've successfully identified the language as requested and provided the final answer. The `Finish` function has been called, and the process is concluded.
