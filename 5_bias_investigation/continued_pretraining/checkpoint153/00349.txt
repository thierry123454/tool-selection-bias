 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my immediate goal is to determine its language. Given the context and the available tools, the most straightforward approach is to use a dedicated language detection API. I will opt for the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, as it seems designed for quick, efficient detection and provides a confidence score, which could be useful for validation.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"}

Assistant: Thought: The API call has returned a result. I need to analyze the output to confirm the detected language and its confidence score. This will guide my next steps, whether it's directly providing the answer or considering alternative methods if the confidence is low.

Action: analyze_api_result
Action Input: {"result": "Spanish", "confidence": 0.98}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function confidently identified the text as Spanish. This is a strong indication that the language detection was successful. Given the high confidence score and the clear result, I can proceed to confirm this with another tool, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, to cross-verify the result, ensuring accuracy.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"}

Assistant: Thought: The second language detection tool, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, has also identified the text as Spanish. This consistent result across two different tools significantly boosts my confidence in the detection. There is no need for further verification or alternative methods; I can now confidently provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?' is Spanish."}
