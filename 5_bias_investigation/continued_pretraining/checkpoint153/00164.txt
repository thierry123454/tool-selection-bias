 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and the task is to determine its language. Given the options available, I'll first attempt to use the `quick_language_detector` tool, which is designed to detect the language from any input text. This tool is straightforward and should provide a quick initial assessment. If it fails or provides an uncertain result, I'll consider alternative methods.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

User: The quick_language_detector tool returned a result. It identified the language as Portuguese with a high confidence score. This seems to be a definitive answer for this specific input.

Assistant: Thought: The `quick_language_detector` has successfully identified the language as Portuguese with a high confidence score. This is a clear and reliable result for the given text. There's no need to explore other tools further, as the task is to simply detect the language, and we have a confident answer. The next step is to confirm this result and prepare to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language detected in the text 'Olá, tudo bem?' is Portuguese."}
