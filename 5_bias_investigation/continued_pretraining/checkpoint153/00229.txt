 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my primary goal is to identify its language. I will first attempt to use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, as it is designed to provide a confidence score, which will be useful for validating the result. This function is straightforward and should provide a quick initial assessment.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: {"text": "Hallo, wie geht’s dir heute?"}

Assistant: Thought: The text "Hallo, wie geht’s dir heute?" appears to be German. The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function should confirm this, and its confidence score will help me decide if I need to cross-check with another tool. If the confidence is high, I can proceed to confirm the language definitively. If low, I might consider using an alternative method.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: {"text": "Hallo, wie geht’s dir heute?"}

Assistant: Thought: The results from the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function confirm that the text "Hallo, wie geht’s dir heute?" is indeed German, with a very high confidence score. This gives me a strong basis to proceed with the task, as I now know the language of the input text. The next step would be to confirm this detection using another tool, such as `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, to ensure accuracy and consistency across different APIs.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language

Action Input: {"text": "Hallo, wie geht’s dir heute?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function also identifies the text as German, which aligns perfectly with the previous result. This dual confirmation strengthens my confidence in the detected language. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and I have now successfully done so with high certainty, I can proceed to wrap up the task.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Hallo, wie geht’s dir heute?' is German."}
