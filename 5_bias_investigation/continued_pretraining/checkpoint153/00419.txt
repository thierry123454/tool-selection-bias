 Thought: The user has provided a phrase, and my first step is to determine its language. I have several tools available, including `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`, `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, and `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`. I'll start by using `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` to detect the language of the input text.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'

Assistant: Thought: The result from `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` indicates the detected language. I'll analyze this result to confirm the language and proceed accordingly.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' has been successfully identified as German.
