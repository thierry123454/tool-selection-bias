 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in Portuguese, and they are asking for its detected language. I should use a tool that can accurately identify the language from any input text. The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` tool seems suitable for this initial detection, as it's designed to determine the language with a confidence score. I'll feed the phrase directly into this tool.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

Assistant: Thought: After calling `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`, I received a result indicating the language with a confidence score. The tool identified the language as Portuguese. Since the confidence score is high, I can confidently proceed with this detection. The user's query is now fully addressed.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language detected in the phrase 'Olá, tudo bem?' is Portuguese."}
