 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my primary goal is to determine its language. Given the nature of the input, which is in Arabic, I anticipate that the language detection tools will be quite effective. My first step should be to identify the language using a reliable detection method.

Action: I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to analyze the provided text.

Action Input: {"text": "مرحبا كيف حالك؟"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has successfully identified the language of the input text. The result indicates that the text is indeed in Arabic. This confirms my initial expectation. Now that I know the language, the next step would be to confirm this detection using another method for redundancy and higher confidence.

Action: I will now use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function to cross-verify the language detection.

Action Input: {"text": "مرحبا كيف حالك؟"}

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function has also returned 'Arabic' as the detected language, aligning perfectly with the previous result. This consistent detection across two different tools provides a high degree of confidence in the language identification. The task now is to present this information to the user clearly and concisely.

Action: I will use the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟' is Arabic."}

Assistant: Thought: The `Finish` function has been called with the `give_answer` option, providing the user with the detected language. This concludes the task as per the instructions. The final answer is now ready to be presented.
