 Thought: The user has provided a sentence that appears to be in Latin, but to be certain, I should use a reliable language detection tool. I'll use the "detect_for_translate_all_languages" function to confirm the language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Salve, quid agis hodie?"}

User: The detected language is Latin.
