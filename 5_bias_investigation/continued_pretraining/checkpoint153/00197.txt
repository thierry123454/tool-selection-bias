 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my task is to determine its language. Given the nature of the input, a direct language detection tool seems appropriate. I will first attempt to use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is designed to detect the language of any given text. This function is often reliable for single texts.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: The function `detect_for_translate_all_languages` has successfully processed the input. The result indicates that the language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian. This is a clear and definitive answer, given the nature of the input. I can now proceed to confirm this with another tool to ensure consistency.
Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function has also confirmed that the text 'Привет, как дела?' is in Russian, providing a good confidence score. This cross-verification strengthens my confidence in the result. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and I have a clear answer, I can now conclude this step.
Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian.
