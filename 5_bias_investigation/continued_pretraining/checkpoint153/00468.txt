 Thought: I need to determine the language of the input text provided by the user. I have several language detection tools available, and I'll start by trying the simplest one to get an initial assessment.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {'text': 'Hej, hur m√•r du idag?'}

User: API call result: {'language': 'Swedish', 'confidence': 0.98}
