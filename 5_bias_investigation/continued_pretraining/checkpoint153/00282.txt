 Thought: I need to determine the language of the given sentence. Since the sentence is in Italian, I should use a reliable language detection tool. I'll start with the quick_language_detector, as it seems straightforward for this purpose.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai oggi?"}

User: The quick_language_detector tool returned 'Italian' with a high confidence score. This confirms my initial assessment.

Assistant: Thought: The quick_language_detector has confirmed the language is Italian. Now, I need to ensure this is the definitive answer, or if there's any room for further verification. Given the simplicity and accuracy of the quick_language_detector, I feel confident in this result. However, to be thorough, I might cross-check with another tool.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai oggi?"}

User: The translate_all_languages tool also detected the language as 'Italian'. This consistency strengthens my confidence.

Assistant: Thought: Both the quick_language_detector and translate_all_languages have consistently identified the language as Italian. This high level of agreement across different tools indicates a strong likelihood that the detection is accurate. I should now proceed to finalize the task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'Ciao, come stai oggi?' is Italian."}

User: The final answer has been provided.
