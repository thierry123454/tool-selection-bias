 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in Arabic. My initial task is to determine its language accurately. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, which is designed to analyze text and provide a confidence score for its language. This seems like the most straightforward approach for a single input.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "مرحبا كيف حالك؟"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function has successfully processed the input. It indicates that the text is indeed in Arabic, with a high confidence score. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, I need to ensure that this detection is reliable before proceeding or if further analysis is required.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟' is Arabic."}

Assistant: Thought: The task is complete, and the final answer has been provided. I have confirmed the language using the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, and the result is accurate. No further action is needed.
