 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and the task is to determine its language. I'll first attempt to use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it seems straightforward for language detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Ciao, come stai?'

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
