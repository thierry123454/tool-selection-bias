 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Japanese. My first step is to confirm the language before attempting any translation. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to identify the language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "今日はとても暑いです。"}

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
