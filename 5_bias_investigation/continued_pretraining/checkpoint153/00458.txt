 Thought: The user has provided a text that appears to be in a language I don't immediately recognize. My first step should be to determine the language of this input. I recall having access to several tools designed for language detection, including `text_language_by_api_ninjas`, `what_s_language`, and `quick_language_detector`. I'll start by attempting to use `text_language_by_api_ninjas` to get an initial detection.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: 'text': 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: I've just received the result from `text_language_by_api_ninjas`. It indicates that the language is Russian. This is a clear and confident detection, which is great. Now that I know the language, I can proceed with the next steps if necessary, or if this is all the user needed, I can finalize the task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: 'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the provided text "Привет, как дела?" is Russian, as detected by the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint.'
