 Thought: I need to determine the language of the given text 'Привет, как дела?'. I have several options, but I'll start with the simplest and most direct approach. I can use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed to detect the language of a text. This seems like a good starting point.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has successfully identified the language. The result indicates that the text is in Russian. This is a clear and definitive answer. Now, I need to decide if this is sufficient or if I should explore other methods for verification or additional context.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian."}
