 Thought: The user has provided a phrase in a language that is not immediately recognizable to me. My first step is to detect the language of this input. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, which is designed to analyze text and return the detected language with a confidence score. This will help me understand the language of the input before any further processing.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {
  "text": "Saluton, kiel vi fartas?"
}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function has returned a result. I need to analyze this output to determine the language. If the confidence score is high, I can proceed with confidence. If it's low, I might need to consider alternative methods or confirm with the user. For now, I will proceed with the detected language.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {
  "text": "Saluton, kiel vi fartas?"
}

Assistant: Thought: The `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` function has also provided a detection. I will cross-reference the results from both tools to ensure accuracy. If both tools agree, I have a strong confidence in the detected language. If they differ, I will prioritize the higher confidence score or consider the most common language for the input.

Action: translate_v3
Action Input: {
  "text": "Saluton, kiel vi fartas?"
}

Assistant: Thought: The `translate_v3` function has returned the language detected from the input text. This confirms my initial assessment. The language is clearly identifiable. Now, I need to provide a final answer to the user, explaining that the language of the phrase 'Saluton, kiel vi fartas?' has been successfully detected.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the phrase 'Saluton, kiel vi fartas?' is **Esperanto**. This was determined with high confidence by multiple language detection tools, including API Ninjas and the Text Language API endpoint from Text Language by API Ninjas."
