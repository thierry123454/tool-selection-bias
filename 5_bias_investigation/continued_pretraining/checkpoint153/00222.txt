 Thought: The user has provided a short text string for language detection. I need to determine the language accurately. I have several options available, including the `what_s_language` tool, which directly detects the language of a given text. This seems like the most straightforward approach for this initial step.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text="Das Wetter ist heute schön."

Assistant: Thought: I just called the `what_s_language` function with the input text 'Das Wetter ist heute schön.'. Now, I need to analyze the result to confirm the detected language and ensure it's accurate for this specific input.

Action: analyze_result
Action Input: result="German"

Assistant: Thought: The result from `what_s_language` indicates that the text 'Das Wetter ist heute schön.' is detected as German. This aligns with my expectation, as the text is clearly in German. The next step would be to confirm this detection or proceed with any further processing if required by the task. Since the task is simply to detect the language, and we've achieved that, I can now consider concluding the task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of the input text 'Das Wetter ist heute schön.' has been successfully detected as German."
