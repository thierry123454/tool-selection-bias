 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase. My first step should be to identify the language of this input. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to analyze the text. This function is designed to detect the language of any given text, which is exactly what I need.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Bonjour tout le monde'

Assistant: Thought: After calling the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, I received a result indicating that the language detected is French. This confirms that the text is indeed in French. My next step is to ensure that this detection is accurate, especially for such a short input, as language models can sometimes struggle with brevity. However, the confidence score from the API suggests a high likelihood of correctness. Now that I know the language, I can proceed with any further actions if needed, or simply confirm the language for the user.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of the text 'Bonjour tout le monde' is French."
