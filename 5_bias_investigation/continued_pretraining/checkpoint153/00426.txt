 Thought: The user has provided a short text string, and our primary goal is to identify its language. To do this, we can leverage the various language detection tools available. The `quick_language_detector` and `what_s_language` tools are particularly suited for quick, straightforward detection of languages from text input. I will first attempt to use `quick_language_detector` for its simplicity and directness.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Dit is een testzin."}

After the call, I will get the call result, and I will be in a new state. Then I will analyze my status now, then decide what to do next.
