 Thought: The user has provided a text, and the task is to detect its language. The text is 'Это тестовое предложение'. I need to determine which language detection tool is best suited for this simple, short phrase. I'll start by attempting to detect the language using the available tools.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Это тестовое предложение"}

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the language is Russian. This seems accurate given the Cyrillic characters. However, to ensure robustness, I should also try another tool to confirm. I'll use `what_s_language` for a secondary check.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "Это тестовое предложение"}

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` tool also confirms Russian. This consistency strengthens my confidence. Now, I need to decide whether to proceed with translation or just confirm the language. Since the user only asked for detection, I'll proceed with the confirmation.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language of the text 'Это тестовое предложение' is Russian."}
