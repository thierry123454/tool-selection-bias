 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a specific phrase. My first step should be to identify the language. I will use the `what_s_language` function, which has a subfunction `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` that is designed for this purpose. I'll pass the phrase 'Olá, como você está hoje?' as the input.

Action: `what_s_language`
Action Input: `text: 'Olá, como você está hoje?'`

Assistant: Thought: After calling the `what_s_language` function, I will receive the detected language. If the language is successfully identified, I will proceed with the next step. If there's an error or the language isn't detected, I'll consider alternative approaches or restart the process.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: `return_type: 'give_up_and_restart', final_answer: 'I will now try to detect the language of the phrase "Olá, como você está hoje?" using the "what_s_language" function. If successful, I will proceed; otherwise, I will restart the task.'`
