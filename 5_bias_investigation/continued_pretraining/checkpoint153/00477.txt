 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and the task is to identify its language. Given the description of the available tools, the most direct approach is to use a dedicated language detection function. I will use the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool, which is specifically designed for this purpose. The input text is 'Dit is een testzin in het Nederlands'.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'Dit is een testzin in het Nederlands'
