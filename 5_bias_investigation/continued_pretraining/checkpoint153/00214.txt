 Thought: The user has provided a sentence, and my primary goal is to determine its language. Given the tools available, the most direct approach is to use a language detection service. The sentence 'Ciao, come stai oggi?' is clearly in Italian, but to confirm this programmatically, I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool, which is designed to detect the language of a given text. This tool should provide a reliable result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai oggi?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool has processed the input text. The result indicates that the language is indeed Italian. This confirms my initial assessment. Now that I have the language identified, the next step would be to proceed with any further actions required by the task, such as translation or categorization. However, since the task description only asked for identification, and I have successfully identified the language, I will now proceed to finalize this step.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'Ciao, come stai oggi?' is Italian."}
