 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and the task is clear: determine the language. The text is "Bonjour tout le monde," which is a common French greeting. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function to analyze this text. This function is designed to detect the language with a confidence score, which will be helpful in confirming the result.

Action: `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`
Action Input: `text="Bonjour tout le monde"`
