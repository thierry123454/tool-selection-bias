 Thought:
The user has provided a short text input that needs to be identified. To proceed, I need to determine the language of this input before attempting any translation or further processing. I will use the available language detection tools to achieve this. My first step is to analyze the input and decide which tool to use for detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: 'Dit is een testzin.'

Assistant: Thought:
The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool has been invoked. It is designed to detect the language of text. The input provided was 'Dit is een testzin.'. I expect a language code and potentially a confidence score in return. This will be crucial for the next steps, as it will inform which translation tool to use if the user requests one.
