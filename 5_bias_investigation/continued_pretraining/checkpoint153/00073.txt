 Thought: The user has provided a Latin phrase, and my first step is to detect its language. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` tool, as it's designed to determine the language with a confidence score, which will be helpful for validation.

Action: `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`
Action Input: {
  "text": "Salve, quid agis hodie?"
}

Assistant: Thought: The language detection result from `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` indicates that the text is indeed Latin, with a high confidence score. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, I need to verify this result using another tool to ensure accuracy.

Action: `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`
Action Input: {
  "text": "Salve, quid agis hodie?"
}

Assistant: Thought: The `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` API also correctly identifies the text as Latin. This consistent result across two different tools strengthens my confidence in the detection. The next step is to provide the user with this information.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'Salve, quid agis hodie?' is Latin. Both the 'quick_language_detector' and 'text_language_by_api_ninjas' tools have confirmed this with high confidence."
