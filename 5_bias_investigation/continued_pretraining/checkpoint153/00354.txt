 Thought: The user has provided a short text in German. My first step should be to confirm the language using one of the available language detection tools. Given the clarity of the input, a direct detection should suffice. I'll proceed with the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Hallo, wie gehtâ€™s dir heute?'
