 Thought: The user has provided a text in Russian. My first step is to confirm the language using a reliable detection tool. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function for this purpose. This tool is designed to detect the language of any given text, which is exactly what I need.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Это пример текста на русском языке"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has successfully identified the language. The result indicates that the text is indeed in Russian. This confirms the user's input. My next step would be to translate this text, but since the task description primarily focuses on language detection, I will proceed to confirm the language and then signal completion.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the provided text 'Это пример текста на русском языке' is Russian."}

Assistant: Thought: The task has been completed. The language of the text has been accurately detected as Russian. The `Finish` function has been called with the appropriate `return_type` and `final_answer`. This concludes the process.
