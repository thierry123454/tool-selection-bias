 Thought: The user has provided a Japanese phrase. My first step is to confirm the language using a reliable detection tool. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to get an initial detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "今日は天気がいいです."}

User: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has successfully detected the language. It identified the text as Japanese with a high confidence score.

Thought: With the language confirmed as Japanese, the next step is to translate the text into English, as that's likely the user's desired output. I'll proceed with the `translate_all_languages` function, ensuring I pass the detected language to it for accurate translation.

Action: translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "今日は天気がいいです.", "source_language": "ja", "target_language": "en"}

User: The `translate_all_languages` function has returned the translation: "Today is a beautiful day."
