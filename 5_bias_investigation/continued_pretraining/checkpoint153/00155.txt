 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Swedish. My immediate task is to accurately identify its language. I have several options for language detection, but I need to consider which one is most reliable for this specific input.

Action: Use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tool.

Action Input: text="Hej, hur m√•r du idag?"
