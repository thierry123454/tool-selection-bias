 Thought: The user has provided a sentence, and the task is to detect its language. Since the input is in Spanish, I need to confirm its language using an appropriate tool. I'll use the "quick_language_detector" API, which is designed to quickly identify the language from a given text. This should give me a confidence score, which will help validate the detection.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás hoy?"}
