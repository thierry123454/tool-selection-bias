 Thought: The user has asked for the language of the text 'Ciao, come stai?'. This seems straightforward. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it's designed to detect the language of text. It's a robust tool for this purpose.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Ciao, come stai?'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has processed the input. I need to check the result to confirm the language.

Action: finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The text 'Ciao, come stai?' is detected as Italian.
