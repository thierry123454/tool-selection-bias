 Thought: The user has requested to identify the language of the text 'Este es un texto de ejemplo'. To do this effectively, I need to first confirm the language of the input text. Since we have several language detection tools at our disposal, I'll begin by using the most straightforward one for this initial check. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it's designed to detect the language of text, and it's often the quickest to respond to simple queries. I'll pass the entire text 'Este es un texto de ejemplo' as the input.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Este es un texto de ejemplo"}

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the language of 'Este es un texto de ejemplo' is Spanish. This is a clear and definitive result, which means we can confidently proceed with identifying the language as Spanish. There's no need for further confirmation with other tools at this stage, as the detection is robust and accurate for this specific input.
