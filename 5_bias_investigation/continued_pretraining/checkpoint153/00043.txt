 Thought: The user has provided a message that appears to be in Cyrillic script. To accurately determine its language, I need to pass it through one of the language detection tools available. Given the simplicity and directness of the task, I'll choose a straightforward approach first.

Action: Detect the language of the input text.

Action Input: `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector(text="Это пример текста.")`

Assistant: Thought: The language detection tool has returned the result. I need to interpret this and decide on the next step. If the detection is confident, I can proceed with translation or further analysis. If it's ambiguous, I might need to try another tool for confirmation.

Action: Analyze the language detection result.

Action Input: (This step doesn't involve a function call, but rather an internal analysis of the previous result.)

Assistant: Thought: The quick language detector has identified the language with a high confidence score. This provides a clear path forward. Now, I should confirm the language using another tool to ensure accuracy, especially for less common languages.

Action: Confirm the language using another detection tool.

Action Input: `detect_for_translate_all_languages(text="Это пример текста.")`

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has also provided a language detection result. Comparing the two results will help validate the accuracy. If they match, I can proceed with confidence. If not, I might need to investigate further.

Action: Compare the results from different language detection tools.

Action Input: (This step is internal, comparing the results from the previous two calls.)

Assistant: Thought: Both tools have consistently identified the language as Russian with high confidence. This confirms the initial detection. Now, the user's request was simply to identify the language, not to translate it. Since the task is complete, I should now provide the final answer.

Action: Provide the final answer.

Action Input: `Finish(return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of the text 'Это пример текста.' is Russian.")`

Assistant: Thought: The task has been completed, and the final answer has been provided. The `Finish` function was called with the appropriate `return_type` and `final_answer` parameters, ensuring that the user receives the information they requested.
