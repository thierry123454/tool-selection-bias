 Thought: The user has provided a short text, 'Bonjour tout le monde', and asked to detect its language. My first step is to determine the language. I will use the `what_s_language` tool, which has a subfunction `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`. This tool is designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code. I will input the text directly.

Action: `what_s_language`
Action Input: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language(text="Bonjour tout le monde")`

User: The API returned 'fr' for the language code.

Assistant: Thought: The API has successfully identified the language as 'fr', which stands for French. This is a clear and definitive result. The task is now complete. I will now call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer and signal the end of this attempt.
