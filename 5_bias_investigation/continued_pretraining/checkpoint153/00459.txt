 Thought: The input text is clearly in Japanese. I need to confirm this using one of the available language detection tools. I'll start with `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` as it seems straightforward for short phrases.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "今日は天気がいいです"}

User: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint returns 'ja' with a confidence score of 0.98.

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has confirmed that the language is Japanese. This aligns with my initial assessment. I will now confirm this using another tool, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, to cross-verify.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "今日は天気がいいです"}

User: The detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code API returns 'ja'.

Assistant: Thought: Both `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` and `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` have consistently identified the language as Japanese. This gives me high confidence in the result. I can now proceed to confirm using the `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` tool, which also provides language detection as part of its functionality.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "今日は天気がいいです"}

User: This endpoint will return the Language of the Text API indicates 'ja' with a high confidence score.

Assistant: Thought: The `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` tool has also confirmed Japanese. This multi-tool verification strengthens my certainty. Now, I will use the `translate_all_languages` API to further validate the detection, as it also has a language detection capability.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "今日は天気がいいです"}

User: detect_for_translate_all_languagess the language of text within a request. API returns 'ja'.

Assistant: Thought: All the tools I've used have consistently identified the language as Japanese. This comprehensive verification process leaves no doubt. I can now confidently provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '今日は天気がいいです' is Japanese."}
