 Thought: The user has asked for the language detection of the phrase 'Olá, tudo bem?'. I will first attempt to detect the language using one of the available language detection tools. I'll start with the most straightforward one, which is `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, as it's a general-purpose tool and often reliable for common languages.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Olá, tudo bem?'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool has returned a detected language. I need to review the result to confirm its accuracy and proceed accordingly. If the language is correctly identified, I can then confirm the detection. If there's any ambiguity or an unexpected result, I might consider using an alternative tool for verification.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Olá, tudo bem?'

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tool has also provided a detected language.

If it's low, I might need to consider alternative approaches or inform the user that the detection is uncertain.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'Olá, tudo bem?'

Assistant: Thought: The `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool has also returned a language detection. I will cross-reference this with the previous results. If all tools consistently point to the same language, I can confidently proceed.
