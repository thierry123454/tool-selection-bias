 Thought: The user has provided a short text snippet, and my task is to determine its language. Given the nature of the input, which is a common greeting in Korean, I suspect it might be Korean. However, to be certain, I should use a reliable language detection tool. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed to detect the language of text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어떠세요?'

Assistant: Thought: The result from the language detection function indicates that the text is indeed Korean. This confirms my initial suspicion. Since the task is to determine the language, and I have successfully identified it, I should now call the `Finish` function with the appropriate `return_type` and the detected language as the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the text "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어떠세요?" is Korean.'
