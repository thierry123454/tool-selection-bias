 Thought: The user's query is straightforward: they want to know the language of a specific phrase. The phrase provided is 'Je suis très heureux'. To determine this, I will first attempt to use a reliable language detection tool. I will use the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` function, which is designed to detect the language from any input text. This seems like the most appropriate tool for the task at hand.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas

Action Input: text: 'Je suis très heureux'

User: 
The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint returned: {"language": "French", "confidence": 0.99}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has successfully identified the language of the input text as French with a high confidence score of 0.99. This result is very clear and definitive. There is no need for further analysis or alternative methods. I can confidently state that the phrase 'Je suis très heureux' is in French. I will now proceed to provide the final answer using the `Finish` function.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of the phrase 'Je suis très heureux' is French."
