 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and the task is to determine its language. Given the nature of the text, which is in Portuguese, I will first attempt to detect its language using the available tools. I will prioritize using the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is specifically designed for language detection and is described as a robust solution for this purpose.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Olá, tudo bem?'
User: 
The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has returned the language as 'pt' (Portuguese) with a high confidence score. This confirms my initial assumption.

Assistant: Thought: The detection of 'pt' for Portuguese is clear. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and we have a definitive result, I can now proceed to provide the final answer. There's no need for further processing or translation in this specific scenario.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the text "Olá, tudo bem?" is Portuguese (pt).
