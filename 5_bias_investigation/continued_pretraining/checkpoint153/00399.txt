 Thought: The user has provided a text that appears to be in Russian. My initial approach will be to use a reliable language detection tool to confirm this. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it's a robust option for language detection. If it correctly identifies the language, I'll proceed with the task. If it fails or returns an unexpected result, I'll consider alternative methods or flag the issue for a restart.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {'text': 'Привет, как дела?'}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has identified the language as Russian. This confirms my initial assumption. The next step is to ensure that the task is complete by calling the `Finish` function with the appropriate `return_type` and providing the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the provided text "Привет, как дела?" is Russian.'}
