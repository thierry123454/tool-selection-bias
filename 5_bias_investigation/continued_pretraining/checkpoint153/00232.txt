 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, "مرحبا كيف حالك," and explicitly asked for its language. To accurately determine the language, I will first attempt to detect it using the available language detection tools. I will prioritize using the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is a robust tool for language detection, and then consider other options if it fails or if a more precise confidence score is needed.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: "مرحبا كيف حالك"

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has processed the input text. It successfully identified the language as Arabic. This is a strong indication that the text is indeed in Arabic. However, to ensure accuracy and provide a more comprehensive response, I will also cross-verify this result using another language detection tool, `quick_language_detector`, to confirm the detection and potentially get a confidence score.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: "مرحبا كيف حالك"

Assistant: Thought: The `quick_language_detector` function has also confirmed that the text is in Arabic. It returned a high confidence score, which further solidifies my initial assessment. Given the consistent results from two different language detection methods, I am confident that the language of "مرحبا كيف حالك" is Arabic.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of 'مرحبا كيف حالك' is Arabic."
