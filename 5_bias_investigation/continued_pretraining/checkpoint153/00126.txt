 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in Russian. My first step is to accurately detect the language of this input. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed to detect the language of any given text. This function is efficient and reliable for this purpose.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="Это пример текста на русском языке"

User: The language detected is 'rus'.
