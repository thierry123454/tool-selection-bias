 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a specific text. The text provided is 'Estou aprendendo português'. My first step should be to detect the language of this input text. I can use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool for this initial detection, as it is designed to detect the language of text. This will give me a preliminary understanding of the language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Estou aprendendo português"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool has returned a language detection result. I need to review this result to confirm the detected language. If the detection is accurate, I can proceed. If not, I might need to verify using another tool. For now, let's proceed with the detected language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Estou aprendendo português' is Portuguese."}
