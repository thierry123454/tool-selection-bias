 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and our primary goal is to determine its language. Given the nature of the task, the most straightforward approach is to use a dedicated language detection tool. Among the available options, `what_s_language` seems particularly suited for this purpose, as its description clearly states it detects the language of a given text and returns the detected language code. We'll proceed with this tool.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text: '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어떠세요?'

Assistant: Thought: The call to `what_s_language` has successfully identified the language. The result indicates that the text is in Korean. This is a definitive answer, and we should now proceed to confirm our findings or move on to the next step if required. Since the task is simply to determine the language, we can now finalize this.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the provided text is Korean (language code: ko).'
