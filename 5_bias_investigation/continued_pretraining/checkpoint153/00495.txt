 Thought: The user has provided a sentence, and my task is to detect its language. I will first use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool, as it is designed for language detection and is one of the most straightforward options available. This initial attempt will help me identify the language of the input text.

Action: `detect_for_translate_all_languages`

Action Input: {"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás hoy?"}

Assistant: Thought: The language detection tool has processed the input. Now, I need to analyze the result to confirm the detected language and proceed accordingly. If the detection is accurate, I can move forward; if not, I might need to try an alternative method.
