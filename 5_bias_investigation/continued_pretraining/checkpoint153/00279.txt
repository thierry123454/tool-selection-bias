 Thought: The user has provided a string, and my immediate task is to detect its language. Given the available tools, I'll use the "what_s_language" function, specifically its subfunction `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, as it is designed to detect the language of a given text. This should provide me with the language code, which will be crucial for any subsequent translation or processing steps.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: {'text': 'Este es un texto de ejemplo.'}

Assistant: Thought: The result from the language detection API is now available. I will analyze this result to confirm the detected language and prepare for the next step, which might involve translation if the detected language is not the user's preferred target. For now, I need to confirm the language accurately.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the provided text "Este es un texto de ejemplo." has been detected as Spanish (es).'}
