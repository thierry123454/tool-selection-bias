 Thought: The user has requested to identify the language of a given text. The task description clearly outlines that we should use the available functions for this purpose. I will first consider the nature of the input text, which is simple and clearly English. My primary goal is to accurately detect the language and then confirm it. I will prioritize using the most direct and efficient method available for this specific task.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "This is an example of English text."}

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
