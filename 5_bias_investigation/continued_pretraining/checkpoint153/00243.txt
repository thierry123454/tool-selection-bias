 Thought: The user has provided a text string. My first step is to determine the language of this text. I'll use the `what_s_language` function, which is designed to detect the language of any given text. I'll pass the provided text directly to this function.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?'

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` function has returned a result. It indicates that the text is in Hindi. Now that I have the language, I can confirm this or proceed with further actions if needed. For now, I can confidently say the language is Hindi.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The text "नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?" is written in Hindi.'
