 Thought: I need to identify the language of the given phrase. I have several tools available, but the most direct one for this purpose is `detect_for_translate_all_languages`. It seems designed specifically for language detection and can handle various inputs.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text='Είναι μια όμορφη μέρα.'
