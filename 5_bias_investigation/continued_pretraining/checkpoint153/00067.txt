 Thought: The user has provided a phrase in Spanish, specifically "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?". My immediate task is to confirm the language using one of the available tools. Given the nature of the input, which is a short, common Spanish phrase, I should prioritize a tool that can quickly and accurately detect language with reasonable confidence.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?"}

Assistant: Thought: The quick language detector has returned a result. I need to check the detected language and its confidence score to proceed. If the confidence is high, I can confidently state the language. If it's low, I might consider alternative tools or strategies. For now, I'll proceed with the detected language.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?"}

Assistant: Thought: After the second call, the quick language detector has confirmed the language as Spanish with a very high confidence score. This is consistent with the initial assessment. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and the result is clear, I can now formulate the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the phrase '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?' is Spanish."}
