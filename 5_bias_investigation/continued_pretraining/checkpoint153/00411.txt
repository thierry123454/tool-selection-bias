 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and the task is to detect its language. To do this, I will first try to use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed for language detection. This function is straightforward and should provide a reliable result for common languages.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {"text": "مرحبا كيف حالك؟"}

User: 
The API returned: {"language": "ar", "confidence": 0.98}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function successfully identified the text as Arabic with a high confidence score. This is a clear and definitive result. Since the task is to detect the language, and we have a confident answer, there is no need for further steps. I will now finalize the task.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language of the text 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟' is Arabic (ar) with a confidence score of 0.98."}
