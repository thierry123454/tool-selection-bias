 Thought: The user has provided a short text in a language I'm not immediately sure about. My first step should be to use a reliable tool to detect its language. Given the available options, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` seems appropriate for this initial detection, as it is designed to "Detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code." It's a straightforward task for this specific subfunction.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: 'Hej, hur m√•r du idag?'
