 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a specific phrase, 'Salve, quid agis?'. Before attempting any translation or language detection, I need to first confirm the language of this input. This is crucial because if the language is already known, we might skip unnecessary steps. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to identify the language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text="Salve, quid agis?"

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has successfully identified the language. The result indicates that the text is in Latin. Now that we know the language, we can proceed to confirm this with another tool, `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`, to ensure consistency and accuracy. This will serve as a secondary check.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas

Action Input: text="Salve, quid agis?"

Assistant: Thought: The `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` function has also confirmed that the language is indeed Latin, providing additional confidence in our initial detection. With this certainty, the task is essentially complete. The user's query has been answered.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The phrase 'Salve, quid agis?' is written in Latin."
