 Thought: The user has provided a text in Korean. My first step should be to confirm the language using one of the available language detection tools. I'll start with quick_language_detector as it seems straightforward for initial checks.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: {
  "text": "안녕하세요, 만나서 반갑습니다."
}
