 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, and my task is to determine its language. I should first consider the tools available and their descriptions. The "what_s_language" tool seems directly applicable, as it is designed to detect the language of a given text. I will use this tool to analyze the input.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text=Ciao, come stai?

Assistant: Thought: The tool has successfully identified the language. Now, I need to confirm the result and ensure it makes sense before proceeding to the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type=give_answer, final_answer="The language of the input text 'Ciao, come stai?' is Italian."
