 Thought: I need to determine the language of the provided sentence. Given the available tools, I think the most straightforward approach would be to use the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool, specifically its subfunction `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`, as it directly detects the language from any input text. This seems like the most efficient path to get an answer.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas

Action Input: text: 'Это пример текста на русском языке'

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint is now processing the input. It should quickly return the detected language. I'll wait for the result.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas

Action Input: text: 'Это пример текста на русском языке'

Assistant: Thought: The API has returned the language. It indicates that the text is indeed in Russian. This confirms my initial assessment. With this information, I can now proceed to translate the text if needed, or simply provide the detected language as the final answer.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the text "Это пример текста на русском языке" is Russian.'
