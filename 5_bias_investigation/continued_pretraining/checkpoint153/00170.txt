 Thought: The user has provided a snippet of text, and my primary goal is to determine its language. Given the nature of the input, which appears to be in Cyrillic script, I suspect it might be Russian, but I need to confirm. I'll use the language detection tools available to me, starting with the most straightforward one, `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, to see if it can identify the language with confidence. If it doesn't provide a definitive answer, I'll consider using other detection methods as a fallback.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Это пример текста на русском языке'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has returned a detected language. I need to review the result to see if it's conclusive. If it's something like "Russian" with high confidence, that's perfect. If it's ambiguous or "unknown," I'll proceed to use another detection method, such as `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, to cross-verify. This step is crucial to ensure accuracy, especially for less common languages or short texts.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Это пример текста на русском языке'

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function has also provided a language detection. By comparing the results from both tools, I can build a more robust confidence in the language identification. If both tools agree, I'll proceed to the next step. If there's a discrepancy, I'll consider using `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` for an additional check, as it offers a confidence score that might help resolve ambiguities. The goal is to have a definitive answer before proceeding.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: 'Это пример текста на русском языке'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function has now returned its assessment. Its confidence score is a valuable piece of information. If the confidence is high, I can proceed with certainty. If it's low, I might need to consider alternative methods or acknowledge that the text might be too short or ambiguous for definitive identification. For now, I'll proceed with the most confident result from the previous calls, as the core task is simply to detect the language, not necessarily translate it.
