 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, 'Ciao, come stai?'. My first step should be to determine the language of this text. I have several options: "what_s_language", "quick_language_detector", and "text_language_by_api_ninjas". Each has its own strengths, but "what_s_language" seems the most straightforward for a single short input. I will proceed with "what_s_language".

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: 'Ciao, come stai?'
User: The language is Italian. See more info at https://api-ninjas.com/api/textlanguage.

Assistant: Thought: The API has confirmed that the text 'Ciao, come stai?' is in Italian. The task is now complete. I have successfully identified the language. The final answer should be clear and concise.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the provided text "Ciao, come stai?" is Italian.'}
