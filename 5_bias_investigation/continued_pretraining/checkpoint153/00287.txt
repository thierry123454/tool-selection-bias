 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my first step is to identify its language. For this, I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed to detect the language of any given text. This will give me a clear indication of the language, which will then inform the next steps if translation is needed.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'यह एक हिंदी वाक्य है'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has returned the language as 'Hindi'. This confirms that the input text is indeed in Hindi. Now that I know the language, I can proceed to the next step if the user requires translation, or confirm the language if that's all that's needed. For now, I'll confirm the language.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the text "यह एक हिंदी वाक्य है" is Hindi.'
