 Thought: The user has provided a short text snippet that appears to be in Korean. My initial task is to confirm its language. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed to detect the language of any input text, even if the language is not explicitly declared. This function is likely to be very efficient for this purpose.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.'

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the language is indeed Korean. This confirms my initial assessment. Now that I know the language, I can proceed with any subsequent translation or processing tasks if needed. However, since the task was simply to detect the language, I can now provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the text "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다." is Korean.'
