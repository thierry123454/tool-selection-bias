 Thought: The user has provided a Latin phrase. My first step should be to detect its language. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function for this.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the detected language is Latin. This confirms that the input text is indeed in Latin. Now, I can proceed with any further processing or translation if needed.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the sentence 'Salve, quid agis hodie?' is Latin.
