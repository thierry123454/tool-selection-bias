 Thought: The user has provided a short text in German. My first step should be to detect its language accurately. I'll use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` tool, as it's designed to identify languages from a few sentences with a confidence score. This will give me a clear indication of the language.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Hallo, wie gehtâ€™s dir heute?"}

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state. Then you will analyze your status now, then decide what to do next...
