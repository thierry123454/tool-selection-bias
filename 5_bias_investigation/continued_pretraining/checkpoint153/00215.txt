 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Cyrillic script, which is a strong indicator of a Slavic language. My first step should be to confirm the language using one of the available detection tools. I'll start with the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function as it's straightforward and commonly used for such tasks.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="Привет, как дела?"

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the text is indeed in Russian. This confirms my initial hypothesis. Now that I know the language, I can proceed with the next steps if needed, but for this specific task of detection, I believe I have a clear answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian."
