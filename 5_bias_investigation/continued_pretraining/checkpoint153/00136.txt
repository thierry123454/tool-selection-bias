 Thought: The user has provided a text string, and I need to determine its language. The first step is to identify the language before attempting any translation, as that would be the correct approach. I will use the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint to detect the language.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك'
