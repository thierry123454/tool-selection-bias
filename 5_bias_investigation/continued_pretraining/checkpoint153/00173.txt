 Thought: The user has provided a specific text, and the task is to determine its language. I will use the available language detection tools to identify the language. The text is "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?". This seems to be a common greeting in French, but I should confirm using the tools. I'll start with the "what_s_language" tool, which is specifically designed for this purpose.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text: "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?"

Assistant: Thought: The "what_s_language" tool has been called. I'll wait for the result to determine the language. If it provides a clear language code, I'll proceed with that. If not, I might consider using another tool as a fallback.

User: The API responded with "fr" for the language code.

Assistant: Thought: The API has correctly identified the language as "fr", which stands for French. This confirms my initial assumption. The task is now complete, as I have successfully determined the language of the provided text.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of the text 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?' is French (fr)."

User: The API has successfully processed the request and provided the language detection result.
