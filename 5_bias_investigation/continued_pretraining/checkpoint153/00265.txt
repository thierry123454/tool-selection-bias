 Thought:
The user has provided a text that I need to identify its language. My first step should be to use a reliable tool for language detection. Given the options, `detect_for_translate_all_languages` seems suitable as it can detect the language of any input text. I'll pass the provided text to this function and analyze the result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'यह एक हिंदी वाक्य है'

User: 
The detected language is 'hi' (Hindi).
