 Thought: The user has provided a short sentence in Russian. My initial action should be to determine the language using one of the available language detection tools. I'll use the quick_language_detector tool, which is designed to quickly identify the language with a confidence score.

Action: quick_language_detector

Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: I've received the result from the quick_language_detector. It identified the language as Russian with a high confidence score. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, I need to ensure that this detection is accurate and consistent with other available tools.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas

Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: The text_language_by_api_ninjas API also confirmed the language as Russian. This consistency between two different tools increases my confidence in the detection. Moving forward, I need to consider how to proceed with this information, especially if the task involves translation or further processing based on the language.

Action: translate_v3

Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?' (Note: While the primary purpose of translate_v3 is translation, I'm using it here to confirm the language detection as a secondary step, as it also has a language detection capability, though it's not its primary function for this specific task.)

Assistant: Thought: The translate_v3 API also identified the language as Russian. This further solidifies my confidence that the input text is indeed in Russian. Given this consistent detection, I can now proceed to provide the final answer, as the task was to identify the language.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the sentence "Привет, как дела?" is Russian.'
