 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my task is to detect its language. I need to choose an appropriate tool for this. Given the nature of the task, which is to "Detect the language of a given text," and considering the available tools, I'll use the `what_s_language` function. This tool seems well-suited for the task at hand.

Action: what_s_language

Action Input: text="Salve, quid agis hodie?"
