 Thought: The user has provided a short text that appears to be in Swedish. My first step should be to confirm the language using one of the available tools. Given the brevity and the potential for quick detection, I'll use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function for its straightforward approach.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: 'Hej, hur m√•r du idag?'
