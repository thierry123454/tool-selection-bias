 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Italian. My first step should be to detect the language accurately. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to identify the language. This function is specifically designed for language detection and should provide a reliable result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text='Ciao, come stai?'

Assistant: Thought: The API has returned a detection. I need to analyze the result to confirm the language. If the detection is clear, I can proceed. If not, I might need to try an alternative method or confirm with the user.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text='Ciao, come stai?'

Assistant: Thought: The language detection was successful, and it clearly indicates Italian. Now that I know the language, I can proceed with any further steps, such as translating if needed, or simply confirming the detection. Since the task was just to detect the language, I can now finalize this.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type='give_answer', final_answer='The language of the text "Ciao, come stai?" is Italian.'
