 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Korean. My initial thought is to confirm its language before considering any translation. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to get a precise detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: '안녕하세요, 만나서 반갑습니다.'

After the call, I receive the result: The detected language is Korean.

Assistant: Thought: The language is confirmed as Korean. Now, I need to decide if the user needs translation or if they just needed language detection. Since the user didn't specify a target language, I'll assume they just need the language identification.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the input text "안녕하세요, 만나서 반갑습니다." is Korean.'
