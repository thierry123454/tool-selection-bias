 Thought: The user has provided a phrase in Greek. My initial step is to detect the language accurately. I'll use the `what_s_language` tool, specifically its subfunction `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, to analyze the input text.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`

Action Input: `text: 'Είναι μια όμορφη μέρα.'`

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
