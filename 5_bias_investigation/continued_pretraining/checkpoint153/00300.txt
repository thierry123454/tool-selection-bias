 Thought: The user has provided a text string that appears to be in Russian. My primary objective is to accurately identify the language of this input. I have several language detection tools at my disposal, including `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3`, `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`, and `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`. I will attempt to use one of these tools to ascertain the language. Given the nature of the input, which is relatively short, I will prioritize tools that are efficient and reliable for quick detection.

Action: I will use `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` to detect the language of the provided text.

Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: After sending the text 'Привет, как дела?' to `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3`, I anticipate receiving a language code. This tool is specifically designed for the `translate_v3` service, which suggests it is optimized for quick and accurate detection. Once I receive the result, I will analyze it to confirm if it correctly identifies the language as Russian.

Action: I will check the result from `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3`.
