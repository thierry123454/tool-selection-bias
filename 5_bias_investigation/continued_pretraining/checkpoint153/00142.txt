 Thought: The user has provided a short text snippet, and the task is to detect its language. Given the brevity and the presence of Spanish words like "Hola" and "cómo," it's likely Spanish, but I need to confirm using the available tools. I'll use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, which is designed to determine the language with a confidence score, making it suitable for this initial detection.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text='Hola, ¿cómo estás?'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function has successfully processed the input text. It returned a confidence score for Spanish, which is very high, confirming my initial guess. This is a strong indication that the text is indeed Spanish. However, to ensure accuracy and to provide a more comprehensive analysis, I might consider using another tool to cross-verify, especially if the confidence score were lower. For now, I'll proceed with the initial detection.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type='give_answer', final_answer="The language of the text 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?' has been detected as Spanish with a high confidence score using the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` tool. This confirms that the input text is in Spanish."
