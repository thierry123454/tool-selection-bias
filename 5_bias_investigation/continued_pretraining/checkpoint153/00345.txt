 Thought: The user has provided a short text snippet, and the task is to determine its language. Given the brevity of the input, a robust language detection tool is essential. I'll first attempt to use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` with the provided text to get an initial assessment.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` will provide a detected language and a confidence score. If the confidence is high, I can confidently proceed. If not, I might need to try an alternative method or request more text. For now, I'll proceed assuming the confidence is sufficient.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool is another reliable option for language detection. If its output aligns with the first tool, I'll have strong evidence for the language. If it differs significantly, I'll need to investigate further, perhaps by checking the confidence scores or trying a third tool if necessary.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` tool is also a viable option. Its purpose is to detect the language of the text. If this tool confirms the language detected by the previous two, I'll be very confident in my answer. If there's a discrepancy, it might indicate a need for a deeper analysis or a fallback strategy.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool is specifically designed for language detection and can handle a wide range of inputs. Using this tool will provide a definitive answer, especially for texts that might be ambiguous with other methods. If all tools consistently point to the same language, I can confidently proceed to the final step.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Olá, tudo bem?' is Portuguese."}
