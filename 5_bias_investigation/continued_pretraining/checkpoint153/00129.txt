 Thought: The user has provided a text that needs its language detected. Given the options, `detect_for_translate_all_languages` and `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` are suitable for this task. I will first attempt to use `detect_for_translate_all_languages` as it is a robust option for language detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui"}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has returned a result. I will now analyze the output to determine the detected language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui' has been detected as French."}
