 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in Italian. My initial thought is to use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tool, as it is designed to detect the language of a given text. This seems like the most straightforward approach for this specific input.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Ciao, come stai oggi?'

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function has returned 'it' as the detected language. This confirms my initial assessment that the input is in Italian. Since the task is simply to determine the language and we've achieved that, I should now call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer and conclude the task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the input "Ciao, come stai oggi?" is Italian (code: it).'

Assistant: Thought: The `Finish` function has been called successfully, and the final answer has been provided. The task is now complete.
