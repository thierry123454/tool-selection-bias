 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, "Olá, tudo bem com você?", and specifically asked for its language detection. The phrase is clearly Portuguese, but to confirm, I'll use the "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector" function to analyze it. This function is designed to determine the language with a confidence score, which will be helpful for verification.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: "Olá, tudo bem com você?"

User: 
The language is Portuguese.
