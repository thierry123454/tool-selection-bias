 Thought: The user has asked to detect the language of a specific text, which is 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'. This appears to be Latin. To confirm, I should use a reliable language detection tool. I'll proceed with the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it's a straightforward and efficient method for initial language identification.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {
  "text": "Salve, quid agis hodie?"
}
