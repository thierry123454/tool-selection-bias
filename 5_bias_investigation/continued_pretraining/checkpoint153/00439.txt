 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Arabic. My first step should be to detect the language using one of the available tools. Given the nature of the input, which is clearly not English, I should prioritize a tool that is specifically designed for language detection. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is robust and provides a clear detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "مرحبا كيف حالك؟"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has processed the input. I need to review the result to confirm the detected language. If it's accurate, I can proceed; if not, I might need to try an alternative method.
