 Thought: I need to determine the language of the given text. Given the nature of the tools available, I'll first try to detect the language using the most straightforward method, which is the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function. This tool is designed for language detection and seems to be a direct fit for this task.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="안녕하세요, 반갑습니다."
