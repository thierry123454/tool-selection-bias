 Thought: The user has provided a single sentence in a language I don't immediately recognize. My first step should be to detect the language of this text. I have several tools available for this, but I'll start with the most straightforward one, which is "what_s_language". This tool is specifically designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Merhaba, nas覺ls覺n?'

Assistant: Thought: I've just received the result from "what_s_language". It indicates that the detected language is 'tr'. This is a significant piece of information, as it tells me the source language of the text. Now, if the task involves translating or further processing this text, knowing its origin language is crucial. For now, I'll confirm this detection and consider the next steps.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the text "Merhaba, nas覺ls覺n?" is detected as Turkish (tr).'

Assistant: Thought: The task has been completed, and the language has been accurately identified as Turkish. This fulfills the initial requirement of detecting the language of the provided text. I've ensured that the final answer is clear and informative, as per the instructions to always call the "Finish" function with a "give_answer" type and a comprehensive final answer.
