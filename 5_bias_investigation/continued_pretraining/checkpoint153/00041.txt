 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase that appears to be in Spanish. My first step should be to confirm the language using one of the available language detection tools. I'll choose the most straightforward one for this initial check.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {"text": '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?'}

Assistant: Thought: The API result indicates that the text is indeed Spanish, with a high confidence score. This confirms my initial assumption. Now that I know the language, the next step would be to translate it if that's part of the task, or simply confirm the language if that's all that's needed. However, since the task description is about handling real-time user queries and language detection, I'll proceed to confirm the language.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?' is Spanish."}
