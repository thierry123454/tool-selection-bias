 Thought: The user has provided a sentence that appears to be in Russian. My immediate task is to confirm this with a reliable language detection tool. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function for this purpose, as it is designed to detect the language of a given text. This will provide me with a definitive answer.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {'text': 'Это пример текста на русском языке'}
