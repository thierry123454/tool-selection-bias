 Thought: I need to identify the language of the given text, which is 'Este es un texto de ejemplo'. I'll start by trying the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, as it seems well-suited for this task.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: text: "Este es un texto de ejemplo"
