 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a specific sentence. The sentence provided is 'Olá, tudo bem com você?'. This appears to be Portuguese. However, to confirm, I should use a language detection tool. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to get a definitive answer.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {'text': 'Olá, tudo bem com você?'}

User: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has successfully identified the language as Portuguese.

Assistant: Thought: The detection tool has confirmed that the language is Portuguese. Now, I need to ensure that this result is clear and ready for presentation. I'll proceed to the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the phrase "Olá, tudo bem com você?" is Portuguese.'}
