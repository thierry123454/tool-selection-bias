 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in Japanese. My first step should be to detect the language using the available tools. I'll use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, as it provides a confidence score, which will be useful for verification.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: text="今日はいい天気ですね"
