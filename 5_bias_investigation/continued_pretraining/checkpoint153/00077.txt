 Thought: The user has provided a sentence, and my task is to detect its language. The sentence given is 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'. Given its structure and the use of Spanish greetings, I'm fairly certain it's Spanish, but I need to confirm this programmatically.

Action: I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function to analyze the text.

Action Input: {"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"}

Assistant: Thought: The API call has returned a result. I need to interpret the output to determine the language and its confidence score.
