 Thought: The user has provided an input text, and my task is to determine its language. Since the input is in a language I don't immediately recognize, I'll use the available language detection tools. I'll start by trying the most straightforward one, "text_language_by_api_ninjas," which is designed for this purpose.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {'text': 'Hej, hur mår du idag?'}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has returned a result. I'll analyze it to see if it provides a clear language detection. If it does, I can confirm the language. If not, I'll consider alternative tools. For now, I'll proceed with the initial detection.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the input text "Hej, hur mår du idag?" has been detected as Danish. If you need translation or further processing, let me know!'}
