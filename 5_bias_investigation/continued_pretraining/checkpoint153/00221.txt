 Thought: I need to detect the language of the provided text. I have several options: `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`, `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`, and `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3`. I'll try the first one, `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, which is quite straightforward.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="This is a sample English sentence."

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates the language is English. This seems correct. Now, I need to confirm this with another tool to ensure accuracy, especially since we have multiple options.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text="This is a sample English sentence."
