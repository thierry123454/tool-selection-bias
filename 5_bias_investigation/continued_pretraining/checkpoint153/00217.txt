 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, and I need to determine its language. I should first consider using the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` tool, as it is designed to detect language with a confidence score. This will give me a quick initial assessment. If it's confident, I can proceed; if not, I might need to explore other options.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Este es un texto de ejemplo"}

User: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` API call returned a result indicating that the language is likely Spanish with a high confidence score. This is a promising start.

Assistant: Thought: The initial detection from `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` points strongly to Spanish. To ensure accuracy, especially with such a short input, I could cross-verify with another language detection tool. However, given the high confidence score from the first tool, it's reasonable to proceed with this result. I should confirm if the user expects a single language or if there's a possibility of mixed languages, but for this input, Spanish seems definitive.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language of 'Este es un texto de ejemplo' is Spanish."}
