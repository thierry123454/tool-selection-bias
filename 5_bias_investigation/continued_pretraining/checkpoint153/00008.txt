 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, and my goal is to determine its language. Given the options available, the most direct path seems to be using a dedicated language detection tool. Among the tools provided, `text_language_by_api_ninjas` appears to be the most straightforward for this specific task, as its description clearly states it can detect the language from any input text. I will proceed with this tool.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'Bonjour tout le monde'

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint is designed to detect the language from any input text. I've submitted the phrase 'Bonjour tout le monde' for analysis. I anticipate a quick response indicating the detected language. Once I receive the result, I will analyze it to confirm the language and proceed accordingly.

Assistant: Thought: The API has returned a result. It indicates that the language detected is French. This aligns perfectly with the input text 'Bonjour tout le monde', which is a common greeting in French. Given this clear detection, I can now proceed to confirm the language with the user or prepare to provide a translation if that's part of the broader task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the text "Bonjour tout le monde" is French, as detected by the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint.'
