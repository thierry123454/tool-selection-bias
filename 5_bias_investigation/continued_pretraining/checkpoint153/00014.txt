 Thought: The user has provided a text that appears to be in Hebrew. My task is to confirm this using the available language detection tools. I'll start by using the `detect` function from the `what_s_language` tool, as it is designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code. This should give me a quick initial confirmation.

Action: detect_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {
    "text": "שלום, מה שלומך היום?"
}
