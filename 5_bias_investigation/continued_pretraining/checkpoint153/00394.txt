 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my first priority is to accurately identify its language. I have several tools at my disposal, each with its own method of detection. I'll start by using the most straightforward one, `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, which is designed to detect the language of text. This tool is efficient and should provide a quick initial assessment.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "今日はお元気ですか？"}

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the text is Japanese. This is a strong signal, but to ensure accuracy, especially with shorter texts, I might consider cross-referencing with another detection tool. However, given the confidence level, I can proceed with this result.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '今日はお元気ですか？' is Japanese."}

Assistant: Thought: The task is now complete. I've successfully identified the language using the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool, and I've provided the final answer through the `Finish` function. This concludes my processing for this specific query.
