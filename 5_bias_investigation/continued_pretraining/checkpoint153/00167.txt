 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, 'Ciao, come stai?'. My first step should be to determine the language of this input. I have several language detection tools available, each with its own characteristics. I'll start by using one of them to quickly identify the language. For this initial attempt, I'll use the quick_language_detector, which is designed to determine the language from a given text.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: The quick_language_detector has returned a result. I'll check the detected language and its confidence score to proceed. If the confidence is high, I can move forward with an appropriate action. If it's low or ambiguous, I might consider trying another tool for verification.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has also provided a detection. I'll compare the results from both tools to ensure consistency. If they align, I'll proceed with confidence. If there's a discrepancy, I'll investigate further or consider using a different tool for a more definitive answer.

Action: translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: The translate_v3 tool has performed language detection on the input. I need to extract the detected language code from the response. This will help me confirm the language identified by the previous tools. If the detected language matches the previous results, I can proceed. If not, I'll need to reassess.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: The translate_all_languages tool has also detected the language. I'll cross-reference the language codes from all the tools. If there's a clear consensus, I can confidently state the language. If there's still uncertainty, I might consider using the what_s_language tool for an additional check, though this is usually a last resort if other tools are already conclusive.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: The what_s_language tool has provided its detection. Now, with results from all available language detection tools, I can confidently determine the language of the input. The phrase 'Ciao, come stai
