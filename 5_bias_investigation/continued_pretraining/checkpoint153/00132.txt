 Thought: The user has provided a specific text, 'Bonjour tout le monde', and asked for its language. My first step should be to detect the language of this input using one of the available language detection tools. I'll choose to use the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' subfunction for this initial detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Bonjour tout le monde"}

Assistant: Thought: The API has returned a detection. I need to analyze the result to confirm the language. If it's clear, I can proceed directly to translation or confirm the language. If there's ambiguity, I might need to use another language detection tool for a second opinion.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of 'Bonjour tout le monde' is French. I used the 'detect_for_translate_all_languages' API to determine this."}

Assistant: Thought: The task is complete. I've identified the language of the provided text, and I've confirmed it using the primary language detection tool. There's no need for further steps.
