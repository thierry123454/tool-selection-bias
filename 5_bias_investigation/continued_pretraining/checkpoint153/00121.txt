 Thought: I need to determine the language of the phrase 'Je suis très heureux'. I have several language detection tools available, but the most straightforward one for this task is the "what_s_language" tool, which is designed to detect the language of a given text. I'll use its subfunction "languagedetection_for_what_s_language" to get the answer.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "Je suis très heureux"}

Assistant: Thought: The translation tool "translate_v3" also has a language detection capability, which I could use as an alternative. However, for a simple language detection task, "what_s_language" seems more direct. I'll proceed with it.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "Je suis très heureux"}

Assistant: Thought: The result from "what_s_language" indicates that the language is French. This confirms my initial expectation. Now, I need to ensure that the user receives a clear and accurate answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The phrase 'Je suis très heureux' is in French."}
