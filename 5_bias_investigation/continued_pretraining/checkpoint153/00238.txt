 Thought: The user has provided a phrase in Korean. My first step should be to confirm the language before attempting any translation. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to identify the language of this input.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?'

Assistant: Thought: The API has returned the detected language as Korean. Now that I know the language, I can proceed with the task as requested, which is to detect the language, and I've successfully done that. The next step would be to confirm this with the user or proceed to the next phase if there were further instructions, but since the task is just language detection, I can now finalize.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the phrase '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?' has been detected as Korean.
