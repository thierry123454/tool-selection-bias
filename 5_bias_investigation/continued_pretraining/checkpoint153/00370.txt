 Thought: The user has provided a text in Spanish, specifically a common question about finding the library. My first step should be to confirm the language using the available tools. I have several options: `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3`, `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`, and `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`. I'll try `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` as it seems straightforward for this purpose.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?"}

User: The API returned 'es' for the language code.

Assistant: Thought: The API successfully identified the language as Spanish ('es'). This confirms my initial assessment. Now, I need to ensure this information is correctly conveyed, as the user has asked for language identification. There's no need for further translation or complex analysis at this stage; the task is simply to identify the language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?' is Spanish (es)."}
