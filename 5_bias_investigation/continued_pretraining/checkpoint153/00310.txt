 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase. My first step is to determine the language of this input. Since the phrase is in German, I need to confirm this using one of the available language detection tools. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is a reliable option for this task.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has processed the input. I will now analyze the result to confirm the language.

Action: analyze_result
Action Input: detect_for_translate_all_languages_result

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` confirms that the text is indeed in German. With this confirmation, I can proceed to translate the phrase if needed, but for this specific task, the primary goal was only to identify the language. Since I have successfully identified the language as German, I can now conclude this part of the task and prepare to provide a final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' is German.
