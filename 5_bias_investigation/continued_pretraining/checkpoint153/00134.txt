 Thought: The user has provided a phrase, and my initial task is to determine its language. Given the tools at my disposal, I will first attempt to use the `quick_language_detector` function, which is designed to detect the language from any input text. This seems like the most direct approach for a single phrase. I will feed the phrase 'Das ist ein schöner Tag' into the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag", "detectedcount": 5}

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
