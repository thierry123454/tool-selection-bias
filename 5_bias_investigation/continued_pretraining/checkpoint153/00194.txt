 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my primary objective is to detect its language accurately. Given the input, 'Ciao, come stai?', it is clearly in Italian. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` tool, which is designed to determine the language of a given text with a confidence score. This tool is suitable for quick and reliable detection of common languages.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` tool has processed the input text. I will now analyze the result to confirm the detected language and proceed accordingly.
