 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Cyrillic script. My initial thought is that it's likely Russian, but to be certain, I should use a language detection tool. I'll proceed with the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` subfunction for the `translate_all_languages` tool, as it's designed to detect the language of any input text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

User: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` API returned: 'ru' with a confidence score of 0.99.

Assistant: Thought: The API confidently identified the language as 'ru' (Russian). This is a strong indication that the text is indeed in Russian. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and the API has provided a clear and confident result, I can now proceed to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian (code: 'ru')."}
