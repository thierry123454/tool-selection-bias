 Thought: The user has provided a phrase that appears to be a mix of two languages, Hindi and Hindi (or possibly a loanword from another language). My initial thought is to use a specialized tool designed for language detection. Among the available tools, "quick_language_detector" seems the most straightforward for this purpose. I will feed the provided text into the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function to determine the primary language.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?'}

Assistant: Thought: The function call has been made. Now, I will wait for the response from the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint to determine the detected language and its confidence score.

Assistant: Thought: The API response indicates that the language detected is Hindi, with a high confidence score. This suggests that the primary language of the input text is indeed Hindi. Since the task is to determine the language, and the API has provided a clear result, I can now proceed to confirm this or move to the next step if further analysis is needed.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the provided phrase is Hindi."}
