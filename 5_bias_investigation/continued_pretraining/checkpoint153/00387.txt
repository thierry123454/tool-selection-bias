 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in Hebrew, and my task is to detect its language. I'll use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function, which is designed for this purpose. It's a straightforward call, and I expect it to return the language code.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text='אני לומד עברית'

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function has returned 'he' for Hebrew. This confirms the language of the input text. Now, I need to ensure that this information is properly conveyed to the user, as per the task description.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language detected in the sentence 'אני לומד עברית' is Hebrew (language code: he)."
