 Thought: The user has provided a single phrase, 'Das ist ein schöner Tag', and explicitly asked to determine its language. Given the nature of the input, which appears to be German, a straightforward approach using a language detection tool seems appropriate. I will first attempt to use the `detect` function from the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool, as it is designed for this purpose.

Action: detect
Action Input: {'text': 'Das ist ein schöner Tag'}

Assistant: Thought: The input text is 'Das ist ein schöner Tag'. I will now process this text through the `detect` function, which is essentially the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool. This tool is specifically designed to detect the language from any input text. Its API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint should be able to accurately identify German.

Action: detect
Action Input: {'text': 'Das ist ein schöner Tag'}

Assistant: Thought: The detection process has completed. The result indicates that the language of the input text 'Das ist ein schöner Tag' is indeed German. This aligns with my initial expectation, as the phrase clearly contains German vocabulary. Now that I have confirmed the language, I can proceed to the next step if necessary, or if this is the final answer, I will call the `Finish` function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the phrase "Das ist ein schöner Tag" is German.'}
