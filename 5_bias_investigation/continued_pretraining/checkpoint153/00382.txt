 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, and my task is to detect its language. I will use the "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector" function, which is designed to analyze a few sentences and return a language with a confidence score. This seems like the most straightforward approach for a single input.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text="Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?"

After the call: The result indicates that the language is French, with a very high confidence score.
