 Thought: The user has provided a short sentence, and my first step is to identify its language. I can use the "Detect the language of a given text" tool for this. I'll try the "what_s_language" function, which wraps the API Ninjas Text Language API, and pass the sentence as the input. If it fails, I'll consider alternative methods or restart.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai oggi?"}

Assistant: Thought: I've just received the result from the "what_s_language" function. It detected the language, which is Italian. This is a straightforward detection, and I'm confident in this result. Now, if the user needs further processing or confirmation, I can proceed, but for now, I've successfully identified the language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'Ciao, come stai oggi?' is Italian."}
