 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and the task is to detect its language. I need to choose an appropriate tool for this. Given the simplicity and the need for a quick, reliable detection, I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function. It's designed to detect the language of any input text, even if the language isn't explicitly known in advance.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="Olá, tudo bem com você?"

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the language is Portuguese. This is a clear and definitive answer for the given text. Since I have successfully detected the language, I can now proceed to confirm this with another tool if necessary, or simply provide the final answer.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: text="Olá, tudo bem com você?"

Assistant: Thought: The `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function also confirms that the language is Portuguese, with a high confidence score. This cross-verification strengthens my certainty. Now that I have confirmed the language using two different tools, I can confidently proceed to the next step, which is to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' is Portuguese."
