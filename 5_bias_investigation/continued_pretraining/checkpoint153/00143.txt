 Thought:
The user has requested to identify the language of the given text: 'Este es un texto de ejemplo'. My first step should be to determine the language accurately. I have several language detection tools available, each with its own characteristics. Given the simplicity and directness of the task, I'll prioritize using a tool that can quickly and reliably detect the language without extensive processing. I'll consider using `detect_for_translate_all_languages` or `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` as they are designed for straightforward language identification. For now, I'll opt for `detect_for_translate_all_languages` as it seems to be a general-purpose tool for this kind of task.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text='Este es un texto de ejemplo'
