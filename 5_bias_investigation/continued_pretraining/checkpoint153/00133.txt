 Thought: The user has provided a phrase in German. My first step should be to detect the language using one of the available language detection tools. I'll start with the `what_s_language` function, which is designed for this purpose.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Das ist ein schöner Tag'

Assistant: Thought: The system has returned the detected language as German. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, I need to ensure that this detection is accurate and consistent with other available tools. For thoroughness, I'll cross-verify using another language detection function.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: 'Das ist ein schöner Tag'

Assistant: Thought: The `quick_language_detector` also identifies the language as German, with a high confidence score. This consistency strengthens my confidence in the detection. Moving forward, I need to consider how to present this information to the user in a clear and concise manner.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the phrase "Das ist ein schöner Tag" has been detected as German by multiple language detection tools, including what_s_language and quick_language_detector. This confirms that it is indeed written in German.'

Assistant: Thought: The task is complete, and the user's query has been handled effectively. I have provided a clear and confident answer regarding the language of the given phrase.
