 Thought: The user has provided a short Latin phrase. My initial step is to determine the language of this input. I have several language detection tools available, including `quick_language_detector`, `text_language_by_api_ninjas`, `translate_v3`, and `what_s_language`. I'll start with `quick_language_detector` as it seems to be a straightforward option for initial detection.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Salve, quid agis hodie?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `quick_language_detector` API returned a result indicating that the language is Latin with a high confidence score. This is a clear and definitive answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of 'Salve, quid agis hodie?' is Latin."}
