 Thought: The user has provided a text snippet, and the primary objective is to detect its language. Given the available tools, I will first attempt to use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, as it is specifically designed for this purpose and provides a confidence score, which will be useful for validation.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}
