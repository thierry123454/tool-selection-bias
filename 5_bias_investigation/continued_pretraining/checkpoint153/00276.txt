 Thought: The user has provided a text that appears to be in Russian. My first step should be to confirm the language using one of the available tools. I'll use the `detect_language_for_translate_v3` function, which is designed for quick language detection and can provide a confidence score.

Action: detect_language_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

User: The `detect_language_for_translate_v3` function has returned a result indicating the text is in Russian with a high confidence score.

Assistant: Thought: The detection confirms the text is in Russian. Now that I know the language, I can proceed with the next steps, which might involve translation or further processing, but for now, the task seems to be simply identifying the language. The user provided the text, and the tool has accurately identified it. My next step is to confirm this with the user if necessary, or proceed to the `Finish` function to provide the result.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian."}
