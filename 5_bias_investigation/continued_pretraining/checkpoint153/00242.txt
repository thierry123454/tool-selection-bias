 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in Russian. To confirm its language, I will use the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool, which is designed for language detection. This will be my first step.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: I'll now analyze the result from the language detection API. If it correctly identifies the language, I can proceed. If not, I might try an alternative method.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the provided text "Привет, как дела?" is Russian, as detected by the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint.'
