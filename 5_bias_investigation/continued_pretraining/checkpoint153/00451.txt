 Thought: The user has provided a short text snippet and asked for its language. Given the brevity, I need to first confirm the language using a reliable detection tool. Since the text is in Italian, I'll use the `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` API to confirm. If it's accurate, I'll then confirm with another tool for redundancy.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3

Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

User: The result from fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3 indicates the language is Italian with high confidence. I'll proceed to confirm using another tool for robustness.

Thought: To ensure consistency, I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` API, which is also designed for language detection. This will serve as a secondary check.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

User: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` API also correctly identifies the language as Italian. This confirms the initial detection. Now, I need to provide the final answer to the user.

Thought: Since I've confirmed the language using two different tools, I can confidently provide the answer. The `Finish` function is the appropriate next step to conclude this task.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Ciao, come stai?' is Italian."}
