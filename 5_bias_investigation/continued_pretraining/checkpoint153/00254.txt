 Thought: The user wants to identify the language of the input text 'Ciao, come stai?'. I'll use the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` function to detect the language. It's the most straightforward tool for this initial detection.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'Ciao, come stai?'

User: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has returned a result. It indicates the language is Italian with a high confidence score.

Assistant: Thought: The language is confirmed to be Italian. Now, I need to decide if I should proceed with any further actions or if this is sufficient for the user's query. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and we have a clear result, I can proceed to wrap up.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the input text "Ciao, come stai?" is Italian. This detection was performed using the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint, which identified it as Italian with high confidence.'
