 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and the task is to determine its language. Since the text is in French, a straightforward approach is to use a reliable language detection tool. I'll proceed with the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is specifically designed for this purpose and seems efficient for quick detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Bonjour tout le monde"}

Assistant: Thought: The API call to `detect_for_translate_all_languages` has successfully returned a result. The detected language is indeed French, which confirms our initial hypothesis. This provides a clear answer to the user's query. Now, I need to prepare the final response and ensure the `Finish` function is called with the appropriate parameters.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Bonjour tout le monde' is written in French."}
