 Thought: The user has provided a sentence, and my first task is to determine its language. I will use the available language detection tools to identify the language. Given the nature of the input, which appears to be in Cyrillic, I suspect it might be Russian, but I need to confirm. I'll start by using the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it seems straightforward for initial detection. If it confirms, I can proceed; if not, I'll consider other options.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

User: The API returned the language as 'ru' with a high confidence score.

Assistant: Thought: The API has confirmed that the sentence is in Russian. This is a clear and definitive result. Since the task was to determine the language, and I now have that information, I can proceed to the final step. However, I should ensure that the result is formatted correctly for the user.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian (ru)."}

User: 
Assistant: The task is now complete. The language of the sentence 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian (ru).
