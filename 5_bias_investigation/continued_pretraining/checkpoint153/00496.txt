 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Japanese. My first step is to confirm the language using a reliable detection tool. I'll use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function, as it is specifically designed for this purpose.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: {"text": "今日はとても暑いです。"}

Assistant: Thought: The detection process is complete. The tool has identified the language. Now, I need to confirm the accuracy and proceed with the task, which is to determine the language. If the detection is accurate, I can proceed to inform the user. If not, I might need to try an alternative method.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '今日はとても暑いです。' has been successfully detected as Japanese using the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tool."}
