 Thought: The user has provided a sentence, and my task is to identify its language. I'll start by using the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` function, which is specifically designed for language detection. It's a straightforward process, and I'll pass the provided text to it.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_textlanguage_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text="Das ist ein sch√∂ner Tag."

After the call, I get the result indicating the detected language.
