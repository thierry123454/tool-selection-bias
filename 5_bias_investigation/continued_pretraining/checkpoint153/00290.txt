 Thought: The user has provided a simple English sentence and explicitly asked to identify its language. There's no need for complex analysis; a straightforward language detection tool should suffice. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to get the language. If it fails, I'll consider `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` as an alternative.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'This is an example of English text'

User: The language of the text 'This is an example of English text' is English.

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function successfully identified the language. This confirms that the input text is indeed in English. The task is now complete.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of the text 'This is an example of English text' is English."
