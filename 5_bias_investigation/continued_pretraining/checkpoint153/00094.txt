 Thought: The user has provided a text that appears to be in Greek. My first step is to confirm the language using the available tools. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function for this purpose, as it is designed to detect the language. This will provide me with a definitive answer regarding the language of the input text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {"text": "Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;"}
