 Thought: The user has provided a text snippet that appears to be in Hebrew. My first step should be to confirm the language using one of the available tools. Given that 'translate_v3' has a subfunction specifically for language detection, I'll use `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` to get a definitive answer.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {'text': 'שלום, מה שלומך היום?'}

The output will provide the detected language.
