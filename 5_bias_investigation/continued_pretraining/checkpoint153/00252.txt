 Thought: The task is to detect the language of the given text 'Het is een mooie dag vandaag.'. I'll use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function, as it is specifically designed for this purpose. It's straightforward and should provide a quick detection.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Het is een mooie dag vandaag.'

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
