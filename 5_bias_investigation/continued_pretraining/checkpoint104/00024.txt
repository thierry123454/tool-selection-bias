 Thought: The user has provided a short Latin phrase, and my first step should be to detect its language. I'll use the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` function for this initial detection. It's designed to detect the language from any input text, which seems perfect for this task.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'

Assistant: Thought: Upon receiving the result from the language detection API, I'll analyze the output to confirm the detected language. If the detection is confident and accurate, I can proceed with providing the answer. If there's any ambiguity or an unexpected result, I might need to explore alternative methods or confirm with the user.

Action: (Based on API result, either proceed or consider alternative actions)
