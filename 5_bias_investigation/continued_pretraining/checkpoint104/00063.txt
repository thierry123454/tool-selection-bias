 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Japanese. My goal is to accurately identify its language. I have several tools available, but for such a specific, short input, it's crucial to choose the one that offers the highest confidence for a single text snippet. I'll prioritize using a tool that is specifically designed for precise, single-text language detection.

Action: I will use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tool to detect the language of the provided text.

Action Input: text: '今日はとてもいい天気です'

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tool is designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code. This should be a straightforward process for a clear Japanese sentence. I'll proceed with the call.

Action: I will call the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tool.

Action Input: text: '今日はとてもいい天気です'

Assistant: Thought: The tool has returned the detected language. If the result is accurate, I can confidently provide the answer. If it's incorrect or if there's an error, I'll need to reassess my approach, perhaps trying another tool or considering the context more deeply. For now, I'll proceed with the assumption that the detection is correct.

Action: I will analyze the result from `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`.

Assistant: Thought: The result indicates that the language is Japanese. This aligns perfectly with the input text, which is clearly a Japanese phrase. Since I've successfully identified the language, I can now proceed to provide the final answer.

Action: I will call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the text "今日はとてもいい天気です" is Japanese.'
