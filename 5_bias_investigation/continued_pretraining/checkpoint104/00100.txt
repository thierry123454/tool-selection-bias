 Thought: The user has provided a specific sentence, and their request is clear: to identify the language of this given text. My initial approach will be to leverage the available language detection tools. Given the variety of options, I'll prioritize a tool that is both efficient and reliable for this specific task. My first step will be to use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is a robust option for language detection. I'll pass the sentence directly to it.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Das ist ein schöner Tag.'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has processed the input. It's crucial to now review the output to confirm the detected language and its confidence level. If the confidence is high, I can proceed with certainty. If it's low or ambiguous, I might consider alternative methods or seek more context. For now, I'll proceed with the detected language.
