 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a specific phrase. The phrase provided is '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?'. Given the nature of the task, I should first attempt to detect the language using one of the available tools. The phrase appears to be in Spanish, but I need to confirm this programmatically. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to analyze the text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text='¿Dónde está la biblioteca?'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has returned a detection, indicating that the language is Spanish. This aligns with my initial assumption. Now, I need to confirm this with another tool to ensure accuracy, as relying on a single detection might not be sufficient for high confidence. I will use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function for a secondary check.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text='¿Dónde está la biblioteca?'

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function also confirms that the language is Spanish. This consistent result across two different tools increases my confidence in the detection. Now, I should consider if there's any need for further analysis or translation, but the primary task was simply to identify the language. Since I have a clear and confirmed answer, I can proceed to the final step.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type='give_answer', final_answer='The phrase "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?" is in Spanish.'
