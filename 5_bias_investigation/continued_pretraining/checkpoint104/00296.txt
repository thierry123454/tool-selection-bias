 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my task is to detect its language. To do this, I will first use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` subfunction to see if it can identify the language. If it fails or is uncertain, I will then try `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` and `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` as secondary options. My goal is to get a confident detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
