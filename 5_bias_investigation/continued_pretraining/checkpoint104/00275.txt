 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my first task is to determine its language. Given the nature of the input, a quick and reliable language detection tool would be ideal. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed for this purpose and is known for its simplicity and effectiveness. This will allow me to accurately identify the language before any further processing or translation.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {
  "text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"
}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has returned the detected language. I will now analyze the result to confirm the language and proceed accordingly. If the detection is accurate, I can confidently proceed with the task. If there's any ambiguity or an unexpected result, I will need to reassess my approach.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {
  "text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"
}

Assistant: Thought: The `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function has also provided a language detection. I will compare the results from both functions to ensure consistency. If both confirm the same language, I can move forward with certainty. If there's a discrepancy, I will investigate further, potentially considering the quality of the input text or the specific characteristics of the language detection models.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?' is Spanish, detected with high confidence by both the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` and `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` functions."
}

Assistant: Thought: The task is complete, and the final answer has been provided. I have confirmed that the language is Spanish, and I have used the appropriate functions to ensure accuracy. The `Finish` function has been called with the `give_answer` type, signaling the end of this particular task.
