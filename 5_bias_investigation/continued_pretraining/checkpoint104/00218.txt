 Thought: The user has provided a sentence, and my immediate goal is to determine its language. Given the tools available, I believe `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` is the most straightforward option for this initial detection, as it specifically targets language identification from any input text. I'll send the sentence through this tool.

Action: `v1_textlanguage_for_textlanguage_by_api_ninjas`

Action Input: `text: 'Это пример текста на русском языке'`

After the call, I receive the result indicating the detected language.
