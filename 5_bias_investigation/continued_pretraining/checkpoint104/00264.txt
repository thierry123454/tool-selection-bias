 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and our primary goal is to identify its language. Given the nature of the text, which appears to be in a Scandinavian language, the most direct approach is to use a dedicated language detection tool.

It offers a straightforward way to detect the language without the overhead of translation, which is precisely what we need here. I will proceed with this function.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="Hej, hur m√•r du idag?"
