 Thought: The user has provided a text that appears to be in Korean. To confirm its language, I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed to detect the language of any given text. This will help me understand the language before proceeding with any further actions or translations if needed.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text='안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어떠세요?'
