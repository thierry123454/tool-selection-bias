 Thought: I need to identify the language of the given sentence. There are several tools available, but I'll start with a quick detection to get a preliminary answer. The sentence is 'Привет, как дела?'. This seems to be a mix of Cyrillic and Latin characters, suggesting it might be Russian or another Cyrillic-based language. I'll first use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is quite versatile and often reliable for language detection. If it provides a clear answer, I can confirm; otherwise, I might explore other options.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {
  "text": "Привет, как дела?"
}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has returned 'ru' as the detected language. This is consistent with my initial assumption that the sentence is in Russian. Since the result is clear and confident, I can now proceed to confirm or translate if needed. However, the task specifically asks for language identification, so I don't need to translate it further. I'll now prepare the final answer, confirming the language detected by the tool.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian (ru)."
}
