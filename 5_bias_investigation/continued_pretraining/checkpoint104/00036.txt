 Thought: The user has provided a sentence that appears to be in Russian. My first step should be to confirm this using one of the available language detection tools. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, which is designed to feed a few sentences and determine the language with a confidence score. This will give me a reliable initial assessment.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: "text": "Это пример текста на русском языке"
