 Thought: The user has provided a text that appears to be in Korean. My first step should be to confirm this using a reliable language detection tool. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to get a definitive answer.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다."}
