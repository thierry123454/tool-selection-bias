 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in Spanish. My first step should be to accurately detect the language of this input. Given the tools available, I’ll use the language detection capabilities directly provided by the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint, which is specifically designed for this purpose. This will give me a confident detection of the language.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: {"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has processed the input and returned a detection. I need to analyze the result to confirm the language. If the detection is accurate, I can proceed with further actions or simply confirm the language. If it's uncertain, I might consider alternative methods, but for now, I'll proceed with the initial detection.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas

Action Input: {"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has provided a detection. I need to verify the result. If both the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint and the quick language detector confirm the language, I can be highly confident. If there's a discrepancy, I might need to consider a fallback or a more robust method, but for now, I'll proceed with the initial detection.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?' is Spanish."}
