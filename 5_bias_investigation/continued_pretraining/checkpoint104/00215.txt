 Thought: The user has provided a text that appears to be in Russian. My first step is to confirm this using one of the available language detection tools. I'll use the `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function, as it seems to be a reliable and straightforward approach for this task.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function has returned a result indicating that the language is indeed Russian. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, I need to decide whether to provide this information directly or if there's more context needed from the user. Since the task is simply to detect the language, I can proceed with the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian."}
