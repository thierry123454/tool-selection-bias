 Thought: The user has provided a string of text, 'Это тестовое предложение', and asked for its language detection. To proceed, I need to identify which tool is best suited for this specific task. Given the description of the available tools, 'what_s_language' seems to be the most direct fit for detecting the language of a given text. I will use this tool to determine the language.

Action Input: text: 'Это тестовое предложение'

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the text 'Это тестовое предложение' has been detected as Russian.
