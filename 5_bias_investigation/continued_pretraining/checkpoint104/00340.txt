 Thought: The user has provided a text and explicitly asked to identify its language. Given the available tools, "what_s_language" and "quick_language_detector" are suitable for this task. I will first attempt to use "what_s_language" as it seems straightforward for a single text input.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text='This is an example of English text'

Assistant: Thought: The result from "what_s_language" indicates the detected language. I will analyze this result to confirm its accuracy and proceed accordingly. If it's accurate, I will use it to inform the user. If there's any doubt, I might consider a secondary check with another tool.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type='give_answer', final_answer='The detected language of the text "This is an example of English text" is English, as identified by the "what_s_language" tool.'
