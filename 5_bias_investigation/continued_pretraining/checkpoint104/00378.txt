 Thought: The user has asked to identify the language of a specific text, which is 'Bonjour tout le monde'. This is a straightforward task that can be handled by one of the language detection tools available. I will first attempt to use the `what_s_language` tool, which is specifically designed for this purpose. If it fails or returns an unexpected result, I will consider using an alternative tool like `quick_language_detector` or `text_language_by_api_ninjas` as a fallback.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: {'text': 'Bonjour tout le monde'}

User: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint returned 'fr' with a confidence score of 0.99.

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has successfully identified the language as 'fr' with a very high confidence score. This is a clear and definitive result. Given the accuracy and the simplicity of the task, I can confidently provide the final answer using the `Finish` function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the text "Bonjour tout le monde" is French (fr).'}
