 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a specific phrase. My first step should be to determine the language of this input using one of the available language detection functions. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is straightforward and designed for this purpose.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {
  "text": "Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?"
}
