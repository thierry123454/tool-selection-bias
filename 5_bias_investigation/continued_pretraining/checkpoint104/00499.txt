 Thought: The user has provided a text, and my first step is to determine its language. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool for this purpose, as it is designed for language detection and seems straightforward for this task.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="Das Wetter ist heute schön."

Assistant: Thought: The API call has returned a result. I need to analyze it to confirm the language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of the text 'Das Wetter ist heute schön.' is German."
