 Thought: The user has provided a phrase and asked for its language. The phrase appears to be in German, but to be certain, I should use a dedicated language detection tool. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to confirm.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'

Assistant: Thought: The API has returned the language as German. This confirms my initial assumption. Now, I need to ensure that the user's request is fully addressed, which involves providing a clear, concise answer.
Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' is **German**.
