 Thought: The user has provided a single sentence in German. My first step should be to confirm the language using a reliable tool. I'll use the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` function for this initial detection.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Das Wetter ist heute schön."}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has successfully detected the language. The result indicates that the input text is indeed German. This confirms my initial assumption. Since the task is simply to detect the language, I can now proceed to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the input text 'Das Wetter ist heute schön.' is German."}
