 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a short phrase. To accurately determine the language, I need to feed the text into a reliable language detection tool. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is designed to detect the language of any input text.
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Ciao, come stai?'
User: The detected language is Italian.
