 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in Russian. My first step is to confirm the language using a reliable language detection tool. I'll use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, which is designed to analyze short text snippets and return a confidence score. This will give me a clear indication of the language.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Это пример текста на русском языке"}

Language detection result: The API returns a high confidence score for Russian, confirming the input text is indeed in Russian. This is a strong indicator, but I'll also consider using another tool as a secondary check for robustness.

Thought: To ensure accuracy, I'll cross-verify the detection using another language detection API, specifically `detect_for_translate_all_languages`. This will provide an independent confirmation of the language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Это пример текста на русском языке"}

Second language detection result: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` API also confidently identifies the input text as Russian. This dual confirmation strengthens my certainty that the language is indeed Russian.

Thought: With two reliable tools confirming the language, I can now confidently proceed with the task, which is to identify the language of the provided sentence. The detection is clear, and no further processing is needed for language identification at this stage.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'Это пример текста на русском языке' is **Russian**."}
