 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Greek. My first step is to confirm the language using a reliable detection tool. I'll use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function for this purpose.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;"}

Assistant: Thought: The API has returned the language as Greek. Now that I know the source language, I can proceed to translate it if needed, or simply confirm its language. For now, the task is complete.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;' is Greek."}
