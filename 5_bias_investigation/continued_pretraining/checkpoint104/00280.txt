 Thought: The user has provided a sentence, and the task is to identify its language. Given the sentence 'Das ist ein schöner Tag.', it appears to be German. To confirm, I will use the "what_s_language" tool, which has a subfunction `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`. This tool is specifically designed to detect the language of a given text. I'll provide the sentence as input.

Action: Use the "what_s_language" tool.

Action Input: {'text': 'Das ist ein schöner Tag.'}

Assistant: Thought: I've just received the result from the language detection. It indicates that the text is indeed in German. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, I need to ensure that the final answer is clear and concise for the user. I will proceed to call the "Finish" function to provide this confirmation.

Action: Call the "Finish" function.

Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the sentence "Das ist ein schöner Tag." is German.'}
