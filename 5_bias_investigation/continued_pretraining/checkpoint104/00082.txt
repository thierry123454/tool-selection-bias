 Thought: The user has provided the text 'Привет, как дела?' and asked for its language. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` tool to determine this.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

User: API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint: {"language": "ru", "confidence": 0.9999999999999998}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has returned the language as 'ru' with a very high confidence score. This indicates that the text is in Russian. I need to confirm this with another tool for accuracy.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

User: API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint: {"language": "ru", "confidence": 0.9999999999999998}

Assistant: Thought: Both API calls confirm that the language is 'ru' with near certainty. I will now use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool to double-check.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

User: detect_for_translate_all_languagess the language of text within a request. {"language": "ru"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool also confirms that the language is 'ru'. I am now confident in the detection. The final answer should be provided using the `Finish` function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the text "Привет, как дела?" is Russian (ru).'

User: The language of the text "Привет, как дела?" is Russian (ru).
