 Thought: The user has provided a text, and my primary objective is to detect its language accurately. Given the options, I need to choose the most appropriate tool for this specific task. The input text, 'Das Wetter ist heute schön.', is a clear example of German. I will proceed with the "what_s_language" tool, which is designed for this purpose.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text="Das Wetter ist heute schön."

Assistant: Thought: I've just executed the "what_s_language" tool. Its purpose was to detect the language of the given text. The result from this tool is crucial for my next steps, as it will inform whether I need to translate or if the language is already understood. I will now analyze the output.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text="Das Wetter ist heute schön."

Assistant: Thought: After processing the text with the "what_s_language" tool, the detected language is German. This confirms my initial assessment that the input text is indeed in German. With this confirmed, I now know the language of the text, which is a significant step forward. The next logical step would be to see if there's any further processing needed, but since the task was simply to detect the language, and we've successfully done that, I can now consider wrapping up. However, as per the guidelines, I must always call the "Finish" function at the end of the task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The detected language of the input text 'Das Wetter ist heute schön.' is German."
