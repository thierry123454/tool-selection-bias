 Thought: The user has asked for the language detection of the sentence 'אני לומד עברית'. This appears to be a common phrase in Hebrew, but to be certain, I should use a reliable language detection tool. The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint is a suitable choice for this task. I will use the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` function to detect the language.
Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text='אני לומד עברית'

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has successfully detected the language. The result indicates that the input text is indeed in Hebrew. This confirms my initial hypothesis. The next step is to provide this information to the user.
Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language detected in the sentence 'אני לומד עברית' is Hebrew."
