 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in a language that is not immediately recognizable to me. My first step is to identify the language so that I can then translate it if needed. I will use the available language detection tools to determine the language of "Saluton, kiel vi fartas?".

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Saluton, kiel vi fartas?"}

User: The detected language is: Esperanto.

Assistant: Thought: The language detector has identified the phrase as Esperanto. This is a useful piece of information, as it confirms the language of the input. Now, if the user intended to translate it, I would proceed with the translation. However, the user only asked to detect the language, so my task is complete.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language of 'Saluton, kiel vi fartas?' is Esperanto."}
