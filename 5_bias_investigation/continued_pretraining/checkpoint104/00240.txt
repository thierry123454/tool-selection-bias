 Thought: The user has provided a text in Cyrillic script, and the task is to determine its language. Given the nature of the input, it's likely Russian, but I need to confirm this using the available tools. I'll start by using a tool designed for language detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

Human: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint detected the language as 'ru' with a high confidence score. This is a strong indication that the text is in Russian.

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has confirmed the language as Russian. This is a clear result. However, to ensure accuracy and to explore other methods, I might consider cross-referencing with another detection tool.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

Human: The API returned the language as 'ru' with a confidence score of 0.999.

Assistant: Thought: The quick language detector also confidently identified the language as Russian, which reinforces the initial result from API Ninjas. This high degree of certainty suggests that the language detection is robust for this particular input.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian. This has been confirmed by multiple language detection tools, including API Ninjas and the quick language detector, both of which identified it as 'ru' with very high confidence."}
