 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in Japanese. My first step is to confirm the language using a reliable tool. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed to detect the language of any given text. This will give me a definitive answer on the language of the input.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text="今日はいい天気ですね."
