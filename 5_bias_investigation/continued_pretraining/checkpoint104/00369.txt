 Thought: The user has provided a short text. My first step is to detect the language using an appropriate tool. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` subfunction, as it's designed to detect the language of any input text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai oggi?"}

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
