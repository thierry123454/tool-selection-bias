 Thought: The input is a Japanese phrase. I need to detect its language accurately. I will use the `what_s_language` function, which internally calls the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text: '今日はいい天気ですね'

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
