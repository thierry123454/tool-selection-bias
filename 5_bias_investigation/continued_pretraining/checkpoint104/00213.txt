 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in Arabic. My initial thought is to use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to identify its language, as it is the most straightforward and general-purpose tool for this task. This will allow me to confirm the language without needing to rely on more complex or specific language detection models.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
