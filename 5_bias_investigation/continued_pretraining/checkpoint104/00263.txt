 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my first step is to determine its language. I have several language detection tools available, and I'll start by using the most straightforward one to get an initial assessment. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to detect the language of the input text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {'text': 'Ol√°, tudo bem?'}
