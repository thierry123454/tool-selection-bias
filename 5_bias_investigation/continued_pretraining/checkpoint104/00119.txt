 Thought: The user has provided a short text, "Het is een mooie dag vandaag." My first step should be to identify the language of this text. I have several language detection tools available, each with its own strengths. I'll start by using one of them to get an initial detection. For this initial attempt, I'll use the "detect_for_translate_all_languages" function, as it's a straightforward and widely used tool for language detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Het is een mooie dag vandaag.'
