 Thought: The user has provided a short text. My first step is to determine its language. I have several tools available, and I'll start with the most straightforward one for language detection.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: {
  "text": "Привет, как дела?"
}

User: The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is detected as 'ru' (Russian) with a high confidence score.

Assistant: Thought: The language detection tool has successfully identified the text as Russian. This is a good start. Now that I know the language, I might consider translating it or further processing it, but for now, the task is simply to confirm the language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian, confirmed by the language detection tool."
}
