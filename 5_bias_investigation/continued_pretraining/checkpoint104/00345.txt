 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my primary goal is to identify its language. Given the tools available, I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to analyze the text and determine its language. This function is designed to detect the language of text, which aligns perfectly with the task.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Ol√°, tudo bem?'

Assistant: Thought: The function call has been made. I will now process the result to identify the detected language.
