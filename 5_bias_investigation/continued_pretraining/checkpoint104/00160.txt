 Thought: The user has provided a short Japanese phrase. My first step is to determine its language. I have several tools available for language detection: `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`, `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`, and `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3`. I'll start by using `detect_for_translate_all_languages` as it seems straightforward and reliable for initial detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="今日はいい天気ですね"

Assistant: Thought: The API call to `detect_for_translate_all_languages` has returned a result. It indicates the language is Japanese with a high confidence score. This confirms my initial assumption. Now, I need to ensure the language is correctly identified before proceeding with any translation or further processing. Since the task is simply to identify the language, I can now proceed to the final step.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of '今日はいい天気ですね' is Japanese."
