 Thought: The user has provided a single sentence, "Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui", and has requested its language detection. Given the context, I will use the available language detection tools. As it's a short phrase, I'll initially consider using the "v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas" tool, which is designed for detecting the language from any input text. This tool seems most straightforward for a single, concise input.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui"}

After the call: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has returned the language as French with a high confidence score. This result aligns with my expectation given the input text.

Thought: The language has been successfully identified as French. Since the task is complete, and I have the answer, I should now call the "Finish" function to provide the final result and indicate that the task is done.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui' is French."}
