 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and the task is to detect its language. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, which is designed to detect the language with a confidence score. This seems like a straightforward initial step.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: text="Ciao, come stai?"
