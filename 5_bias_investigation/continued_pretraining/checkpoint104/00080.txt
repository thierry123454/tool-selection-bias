 Thought: The user wants to identify the language of the given text, 'Ciao, come va?'. Since we have several language detection tools available, I'll first attempt to use the most straightforward one that specifically targets language detection. The tool `what_s_language` seems ideal for this task as it is designed to detect the language of a given text. I'll use the subfunction `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` to process this input.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {'text': 'Ciao, come va?'}
