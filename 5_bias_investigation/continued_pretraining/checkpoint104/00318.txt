 Thought: The user has provided a text that appears to be in Japanese. My first step should be to confirm the language using one of the available detection tools.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: {'text': '今日はお元気ですか？'}

Assistant: Thought: The response from the `what_s_language` function indicates that the text is indeed in Japanese. This confirms my initial assessment.

Action: translate_v3
Action Input: {'text': '今日はお元気ですか？'}

Assistant: Thought: The `translate_v3` function also correctly identified the language as Japanese, and it provided a translation. This further validates the language detection.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the text "今日はお元気ですか？" is Japanese. This was confirmed by multiple detection methods, including "what_s_language" and "translate_v3."'}
