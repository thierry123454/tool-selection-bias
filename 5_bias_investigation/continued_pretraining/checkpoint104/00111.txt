 Thought: The user has asked to identify the language of the text 'Merhaba, nasılsın?'. This is a straightforward language detection task, and we have several tools available for this. Given the simplicity of the query, I will proceed with a direct detection using one of the language detection APIs. I will first attempt to use the 'what_s_language' tool, which is designed for this purpose.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "Merhaba, nasılsın?"}

Assistant: Thought: The tool 'what_s_language' has returned the detected language as 'tr' (Turkish). This is a clear and confident result. Since we have successfully identified the language, the task is effectively complete.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of 'Merhaba, nasılsın?' is Turkish."}
