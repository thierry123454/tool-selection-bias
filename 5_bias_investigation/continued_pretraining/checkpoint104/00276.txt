 Thought: The user has provided a text string, and the task is to identify its language. I will use the language detection capabilities of the available tools. The text appears to be in Cyrillic, so it's likely Russian or another Slavic language. I will first attempt to use the `what_s_language` tool, which has a direct function `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` for this purpose. If it fails or is too slow, I will consider other options.

Action: `what_s_language`
Action Input: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language(text="Привет, как дела?")`

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` tool has returned a result. It identified the language as 'ru' (Russian). This is a clear and confident detection, which is excellent. There is no need to proceed with other tools for this specific input. The task is now complete, and I can provide the final answer.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: `Finish(return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian (code: ru).")`
