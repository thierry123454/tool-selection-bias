 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in Latin. My first step is to confirm the language using one of the available language detection tools. I'll use the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` function, specifically its subfunction `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: 'text': 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has processed the input. It will provide the detected language. I will proceed with the result.

Action: Finish
Action Input: 'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the sentence "Salve, quid agis hodie?" is Latin, as detected by the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint.'
