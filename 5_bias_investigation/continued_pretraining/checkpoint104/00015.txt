 Thought: The user has provided a text snippet. My first step is to determine its language. I have several options: quick_language_detector, text_language_by_api_ninjas, translate_v3, translate_all_languages, and what_s_language. I'll start with quick_language_detector, as it seems straightforward for initial detection.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?"}

User: quick_language_detector returned {'language': 'ko', 'confidence': 0.98}

Assistant: Thought: The quick_language_detector confidently identified the text as Korean. This is a strong indication, but to ensure accuracy and explore other methods, I might consider another tool or confirm with the user if the context is ambiguous. For now, I'll proceed with this initial detection.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?' is Korean, as identified by quick_language_detector with a high confidence score."}
