 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my task is to determine its language. The text is 'Olá, tudo bem com você?'. Given its brevity, a single, definitive detection might be challenging, but I can certainly attempt it using one of the available tools. I'll first try the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, as it is designed to detect language with a confidence score, which is useful for short texts.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text="Olá, tudo bem com você?"

User: The quick_language_detector API endpoint returned a result for 'Olá, tudo bem com você?': {'language': 'pt', 'confidence': 0.98}. This indicates a high confidence in detecting Portuguese.

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function has successfully identified the language as Portuguese with a very high confidence score. This is a strong indicator that the text is indeed in Portuguese. However, to ensure accuracy and cover all bases, I might consider using another tool, such as `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`, to cross-verify this result.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text="Olá, tudo bem com você?"

User: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has processed 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' and returned: {'language': 'pt', 'confidence': 0.99}. This further confirms that the language is Portuguese with an even higher confidence score.

Assistant: Thought: Both `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` and `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` have consistently identified the language as Portuguese with very high confidence scores. This strong agreement between two different tools provides a robust basis for my conclusion. There is no need for further testing or alternative tools. The task is clear: the language of 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' is Portuguese.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' is Portuguese."
