 Thought: The user has provided a short Japanese phrase. My first step should be to detect its language. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to analyze the input text directly.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: '今日は良い天気ですね'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has processed the input. I need to interpret the result to determine the language.
