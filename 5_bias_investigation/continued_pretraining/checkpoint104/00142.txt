 Thought: The user has provided a text snippet, and the task is clear: detect its language. Given the input, it appears to be in Spanish. However, to ensure accuracy, I should confirm this using one of the available language detection tools. I'll proceed with the most straightforward option, `what_s_language`, which is designed for this purpose.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: {'text': 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'}

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` function is designed to detect the language of a given text. I'll pass the user's input directly to it to get the detected language. If the result is conclusive, I can proceed to confirm its accuracy.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {'text': 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'}

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction has now processed the text. I need to check the output to see if it confidently identifies the language as Spanish. If it does, I can proceed to confirm the result. If not, I might need to explore alternative methods or consider the possibility of an ambiguous input.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {'text': 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?', 'detectedcount': 5}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` API has also been called with the same text. This tool provides a confidence score, which will be crucial in assessing the accuracy of the detection. If the confidence score is high and the detected language matches the output from `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, I can be more confident in the result. If not, I might need to consider other tools or re-evaluate the input.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {'text': 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'}

Assistant: Thought: The `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` endpoint is another option for language detection. It should provide a language code. I'll compare its output with the previous results to ensure consistency. If all three tools agree on Spanish, I can be highly confident in the detection. If there's a discrepancy, I'll need to investigate further.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {'text': 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'}

Assistant: Thought: The `fast_language_detection
