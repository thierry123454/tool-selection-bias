 Thought: I need to detect the language of the given sentence. I have several options, but the most straightforward is to use the `detect` function from the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool. This tool is designed to detect the language from any input text, which seems perfect for this task. I'll proceed with that.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Hello, how are you today?"}

Assistant: Thought: The language detection tool has successfully identified the language. Now, I need to analyze the result to confirm it's accurate and then proceed with the task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'Hello, how are you today?' has been detected as English."}

Assistant: Thought: The task is complete. I've successfully detected the language using the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool and provided the final answer.
