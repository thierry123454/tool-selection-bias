 Thought: The user has provided a text in Japanese, which is a common language for language detection. I’ll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to identify the language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: '今日はとても暑いです。'

Human: Result: The language detected is Japanese.

Assistant: Thought: Since the language is already identified as Japanese, I don't need to use the `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` or `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` functions here, as they are primarily for translation. The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has already given me the answer. I will proceed to confirm if this is the correct language for the given text.

Action: Confirm
Action Input: N/A

Human: Result: The detection is correct. The text '今日はとても暑いです。' is indeed in Japanese.

Assistant: Thought: Now that I have confirmed the language, I can proceed to translate the text if needed, or simply confirm its language. Since the task description primarily involves language detection, I will proceed to confirm the language and then signal completion.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the text '今日はとても暑いです。' is Japanese.
