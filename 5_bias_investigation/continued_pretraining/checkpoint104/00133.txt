 Thought: The user has provided a phrase, and the task is to identify its language. Given the phrase 'Das ist ein schöner Tag', it appears to be German. To confirm this, I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed to detect the language of any input text. This function is reliable for such a straightforward case.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has been called with the input 'Das ist ein schöner Tag'. The result indicates that the language detected is indeed German. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, I need to ensure that this is the final answer and that the task is complete.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the phrase 'Das ist ein schöner Tag' is German."}
