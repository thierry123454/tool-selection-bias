 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in Russian. My immediate goal is to accurately detect the language so that we can proceed with appropriate actions, such as translation or further processing. The most straightforward approach is to use a dedicated language detection tool. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed to detect the language of any input text. This function is efficient and reliable for this specific task.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Это пример текста на русском языке'

Assistant: Thought: I've just received the result from the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function. It has successfully identified the language of the input text. The output indicates that the language is indeed Russian. This confirms my initial assessment and provides a clear basis for any subsequent actions, such as translating the text into another language or providing more information about the content. The confidence score, if provided, would be useful, but for this specific task, the detection itself is sufficient.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of the sentence 'Это пример текста на русском языке' has been successfully detected as Russian."
