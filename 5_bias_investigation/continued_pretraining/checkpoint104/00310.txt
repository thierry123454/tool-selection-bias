 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in German. My first step should be to detect the language using one of the available language detection tools. I'll try the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it seems straightforward for initial detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {
  "text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"
}

Assistant: Thought: The result from the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function indicates that the language is German with a high confidence score. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, I need to proceed with the task as described, which involves using functions to handle real-time user queries. Since the language is already identified, I can now consider other actions, but for now, I'll confirm the language detection and prepare for the next step if needed.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' is German. I used the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to confirm this."
}
