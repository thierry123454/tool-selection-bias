 Thought: The user has asked for the language of the sentence 'אני לומד עברית'. This is a straightforward request, and I can use one of the available language detection tools. I'll start by using the `what_s_language` tool, which is specifically designed for this purpose. It's a simple and direct approach.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'אני לומד עברית'

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` tool returned 'he' (Hebrew). This confirms that the sentence is indeed in Hebrew. My task is now complete, and I have the answer. I should now call the `Finish` function to provide the final result.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language detected in the sentence "אני לומד עברית" is Hebrew (he).'

Assistant: Thought: The `Finish` function has been called, and the final answer is now ready to be presented to the user. The task is complete.
