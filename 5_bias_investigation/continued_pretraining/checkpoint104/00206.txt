 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in Italian. My immediate goal is to accurately identify the language. Given the tools at my disposal, I can use the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` function, which is specifically designed for this purpose. I'll feed the text directly into the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` subfunction.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint is a reliable choice for language detection. I'll proceed with the call to see the result.
