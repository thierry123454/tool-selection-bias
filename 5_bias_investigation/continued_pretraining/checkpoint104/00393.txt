 Thought: The user has asked to detect the language of a specific phrase. The phrase provided is 'Olá, tudo bem?'. Given that it contains Portuguese words, it's clear it's Portuguese, but let's confirm using the available tools. I'll use the `what_s_language` function, specifically its subfunction `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, to detect the language and then confirm with the `translate_v3` function's `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` to ensure accuracy.

Action: Detect the language of the provided text using `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`.

Action Input: 'text'='Olá, tudo bem?'

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function has returned 'pt' (Portuguese) with high confidence. This aligns with my initial assessment. To further validate, I'll use the `translate_v3` function's `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` on the same input.

Action: Detect the language of the provided text using `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3`.

Action Input: 'text'='Olá, tudo bem?'

Assistant: Thought: The `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function also returned 'pt' (Portuguese). This consistent result across two different language detection tools confirms that the phrase 'Olá, tudo bem?' is indeed in Portuguese. I can now confidently provide the final answer.

Action: Call `Finish` to provide the final answer.

Action Input: 'return_type'='give_answer', 'final_answer'='The language detected in the phrase "Olá, tudo bem?" is Portuguese (pt).'
