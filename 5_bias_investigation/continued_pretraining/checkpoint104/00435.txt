 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my primary goal is to determine its language. I have several language detection tools available, but I need to decide which one is most appropriate for this specific input. The text is quite brief, so I should consider a tool that can reliably detect language even with less context. I will first try the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool, which is a general-purpose language detector.

Action: `text_language_by_api_ninjas`
Action Input: '{"text": "Bonjour tout le monde"}'

Assistant: Thought: The `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool has returned a result. I need to analyze the output to confirm the detected language. If the detection is accurate, I can proceed to confirm the answer. If there's any ambiguity or an error, I might consider using an alternative tool.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: '{"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Bonjour tout le monde' is written in French."}'
