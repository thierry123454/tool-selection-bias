 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my primary objective is to accurately determine its language. Given the available tools, I will first attempt to use the `what_s_language` function, which is designed to detect the language of a given text. This will be my initial step.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: language_detection_for_what_s_language(text='안녕하세요, 반갑습니다')
Result: The `what_s_language` function successfully identified the language as "ko" (Korean) with a high confidence score. This is a promising start, as "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다" is a common greeting in Korean.

Thought: The initial detection was successful, confirming that the text is indeed in Korean. My next step would be to ensure this detection is robust and to consider any potential edge cases, though for a simple phrase like this, the confidence is likely very high. However, to be thorough, I might consider using another language detection tool to cross-verify, or if the context demands it, perhaps even attempt a translation, though that's not strictly necessary for just identifying the language.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: quick_language_detector(text='안녕하세요, 반갑습니다')
Result: The `quick_language_detector` also identified the language as "ko" with a very high confidence score, consistent with the first tool's output. This reinforces my initial detection.

Thought: Both tools have concurred on the language being Korean, which gives me a high degree of certainty. Since the task is simply to detect the language, and I've achieved that with high confidence, I can proceed to conclude the task. The next step, then, is to finalize the process.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of the text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다' is Korean (code: 'ko')."
Result: The task is now complete. The final answer has been provided.
