 Thought: The user has provided a short Arabic phrase. My first step is to confirm the language using a reliable tool. I'll use the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` function to detect the language from the given text.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {'text': 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'}

Assistant: Thought: The result from the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint should provide the detected language. Once I have that, I can proceed to confirm or use it for further processing.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of "مرحبا كيف حالك؟" is Arabic.'}
