 Thought: The user has provided an input text, and the task is to identify its language. I'll use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, which is designed to detect the language of a given text with a confidence score. This seems like the most straightforward approach for this initial detection.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: text: 'Hej, hur m√•r du idag?'
