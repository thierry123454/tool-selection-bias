 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and the task is to identify its language. I will first try to detect the language using the available tools. I’ll start with `detect_for_translate_all_languages` as it seems straightforward for language detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Dit is een testzin.'

User: The language detected for 'Dit is een testzin.' is Dutch.

Assistant: Thought: The tool has identified the language as Dutch. Now, I need to confirm this result using another language detection tool for cross-verification. I’ll use `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` next.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language

Action Input: text: 'Dit is een testzin.'

User: The language detected for 'Dit is een testzin.' is Dutch.

Assistant: Thought: Both tools have consistently identified the language as Dutch. This confirms the result. The task is complete, and I can now provide the final answer.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of the input text 'Dit is een testzin.' is Dutch."
