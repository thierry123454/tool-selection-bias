 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, and my immediate goal is to determine its language. Given the context, I'll first attempt to use the `what_s_language` tool, which is specifically designed for this purpose. This tool is straightforward and directly addresses the task. If it fails or doesn't provide a clear answer, I'll consider alternative methods, but for now, I'll proceed with this.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text: '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?'

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` tool has returned 'es' (Spanish) with a high confidence score. This is a clear and definitive result, indicating that the text is indeed in Spanish. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and the tool has provided a confident answer, I can now conclude this step and move towards providing the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the text "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?" is Spanish (es).'
