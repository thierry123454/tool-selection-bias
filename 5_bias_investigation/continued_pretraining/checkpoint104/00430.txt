 Thought: The user has provided a specific text, and the task is to detect its language. I will first use the appropriate language detection tool to identify the language of the given text. Since the text is in French, I will leverage the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed for language detection and translation. This function is a good fit for this initial step.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?"

Assistant: Thought: I have now received the initial language detection result. The API has successfully identified the language. The next step would be to confirm the accuracy or to proceed with further actions if needed. For now, I will proceed to confirm and then encapsulate the result in a final answer using the `Finish` function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: "give_answer", final_answer: "The language of the text 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?' has been detected as French by the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function."
