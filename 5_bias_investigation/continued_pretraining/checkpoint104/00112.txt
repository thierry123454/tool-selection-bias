 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in Russian. My first step should be to confirm the language using one of the available language detection tools. I will attempt to use the 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' function, as it is a dedicated language detection service, to get an accurate result.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {'text': 'Привет, как дела?'}

Assistant: Thought: The function 'fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3' has returned that the language is indeed Russian. This confirms the user's input. The next step is to provide a clear and concise answer to the user, indicating that the language of the sentence is Russian.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the sentence "Привет, как дела?" is Russian.'}
