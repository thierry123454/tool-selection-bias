 Thought: The user has provided a short text in German. My first step is to determine the language of this input. I have several tools available for language detection, and I'll start with the most straightforward one for quick identification. I'll use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function.

Action: `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`
Action Input: `{"text": "Hallo, wie gehtâ€™s dir heute?"}`
