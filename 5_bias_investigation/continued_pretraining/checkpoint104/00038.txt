 Thought: The user has provided a text in Korean. My immediate goal is to confirm its language using one of the available language detection tools. I'll start with the `what_s_language` function, which specifically aims to detect the language of a given text. This seems like a straightforward and appropriate first step.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어떠세요?'

Assistant: Thought: The result from the `what_s_language` function indicates that the text is indeed in Korean. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, I need to ensure the accuracy of this detection, as sometimes language identification can be ambiguous, especially with very short texts. I'll cross-verify using the `quick_language_detector` function.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어떠세요?'

Assistant: Thought: The `quick_language_detector` function also returns Korean, along with a high confidence score, which further solidifies my confidence in the detection. To ensure comprehensive coverage, I'll also use the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` function, which is another reliable option.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어떠세요?'

Assistant: Thought: The `text_language_by_api_ninjas` function concurs, identifying the language as Korean. This multi-tool verification is crucial for high confidence in the result. Now, I need to decide how to proceed. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and I've achieved that with high certainty, I can now provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the provided text "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어떠세요?" is Korean.'
