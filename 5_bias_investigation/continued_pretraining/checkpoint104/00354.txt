 Thought: The user has provided a short text in German. My first step should be to detect its language using the available tools. I will use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function for this purpose.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`

Action Input: `text: 'Hallo, wie gehtâ€™s dir heute?'`
