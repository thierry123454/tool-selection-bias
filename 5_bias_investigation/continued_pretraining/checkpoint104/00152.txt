 Thought: The user has provided a text string, and the task is to detect its language. Given the availability of tools like `quick_language_detector` and `text_language_by_api_ninjas`, I'll first attempt to use `quick_language_detector` for its simplicity and quick response.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {'text': 'Je suis tr√®s heureux aujourd'hui'}

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
