 Thought: The user has provided a short text and explicitly asked for its language. My first step is to detect the language using one of the available tools. Given the simplicity of the task, I'll start by using `detect_for_translate_all_languages` to see if it can quickly identify the language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {'text': 'Dit is een testzin in het Nederlands'}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool has returned a result. It indicates that the language is Dutch with a high confidence score. This is a clear and definitive answer for this specific text. Since the task is complete, I will now proceed to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the text "Dit is een testzin in het Nederlands" is Dutch.'}
