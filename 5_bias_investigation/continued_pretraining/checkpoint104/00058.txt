 Thought: The user has provided a phrase, and the task is to identify its language. Given the phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?', it's clear it's in German. To confirm, I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is specifically designed for language detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has successfully identified the language. The result indicates that the text is indeed in German. Now, I need to confirm if this is the definitive answer or if further processing is required. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and the detection is clear, I can proceed to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the phrase "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?" is German.'
