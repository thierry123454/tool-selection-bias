 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, and they specifically asked for the language to be identified. Given the brevity of the input, it's crucial to first detect the language accurately, as this will inform any subsequent translation or processing steps. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool, which is specifically designed for language detection and is a reliable choice for this initial step. This tool can also detect the language even if it's not explicitly stated, which is a significant advantage.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool has successfully processed the input text. It is now ready to provide the detected language. The next step would be to confirm the accuracy of this detection, especially since the input is quite short. If the detection is accurate, I can proceed with any further actions, such as translation. If not, I might consider alternative methods or a second confirmation.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: "give_answer", final_answer: "The detected language of 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian."
