 Thought: The user has provided a specific sentence and asked for its language. The most direct approach is to use a dedicated language detection tool. I'll use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function, as it's designed specifically for this purpose. It's efficient and straightforward for a single input.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: { "text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?" }

Assistant: Thought: The output from the language detection API is received. It indicates the detected language. The next step is to confirm the result and, if necessary, provide a more detailed explanation to the user, perhaps including a confidence score if available. For now, I'll proceed with the detected language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: { "return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?' is Spanish." }
