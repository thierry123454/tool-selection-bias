 Thought: The user has provided a phrase, and the task is to identify its language. The phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' appears to be in German. To confirm, I will use a language detection tool. I'll start by using the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, as it's designed to detect the language of a given text.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"}
