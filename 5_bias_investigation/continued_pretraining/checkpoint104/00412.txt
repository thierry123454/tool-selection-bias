 Thought: The user has provided a text in Arabic. My immediate goal is to confirm the language using one of the available tools. Given the simplicity and directness of the text, I'll prioritize using a tool that can quickly detect the language with minimal input processing.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'

Assistant: Thought: The API call has returned a result. I need to analyze this output to determine the language confidently. The result will indicate the detected language, and I should proceed based on that. If the detection is ambiguous or the confidence score is low, I might consider alternative methods or a secondary check.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language

Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'

Assistant: Thought: The second API call also returned a result. I should now compare the outputs from both tools to ensure consistency. If they agree, I can proceed with high confidence. If there's a discrepancy, I'll need to investigate further, perhaps by using a third tool or by considering the context of the input.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'

Assistant: Thought: The quick language detector has also provided a language detection. Now, I have results from three different language detection tools. I need to evaluate these results comprehensively. If all three tools consistently point to the same language, I can be very confident in my detection. If there's any deviation, I'll need to identify the most probable language based on the majority or the most authoritative tool's output.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the text "مرحبا كيف حالك؟" has been consistently detected as Arabic by multiple language detection tools, including "translate_all_languages", "what_s_language", and "quick_language_detector". This confirms that the text is indeed in Arabic.'
