 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, and my task is to determine its language. I'll start by using a reliable language detection tool. I'll try the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, which is designed to detect language with a confidence score. This seems like a good initial choice for a quick and accurate result.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Merhaba, nasılsın?"}

Assistant: Thought: The API call has been made. I'll now check the result to see if the language and confidence score are clear enough for a definitive answer. If the confidence is high, I can proceed. If it's low or ambiguous, I might consider alternative methods.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Merhaba, nasılsın?"}

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` indicates that the language is 'tr' (Turkish) with a high confidence score. This is a strong indication that the phrase is indeed in Turkish. Since the confidence is high, I can confidently proceed with this detection. I won't need to call any other language detection tools for this specific input.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of 'Merhaba, nasılsın?' is 'tr' (Turkish) with high confidence."}
