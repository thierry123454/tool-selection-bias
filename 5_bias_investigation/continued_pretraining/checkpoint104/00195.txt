 Thought: The user has provided a phrase and explicitly asked for its language. The phrase is 'Das ist ein schöner Tag'. Given that it's a common German phrase, I'll first try to confirm its language using the available tools. I'll start with the quick_language_detector, as it's designed for this purpose. If it's not confident, I'll consider alternative methods.

Action: quick_language_detector
Action Input: text="Das ist ein schöner Tag"

User: The quick_language_detector API returned a result. It identified the language as German with a very high confidence score. This is a strong indicator.

Assistant: Thought: The quick_language_detector has confirmed that the phrase is indeed German. Given the high confidence, there's no need to run it through other language detection APIs. However, to ensure accuracy and to explore other options, I'll also run it through the translate_all_languages API, which also has a language detection capability. This will serve as a secondary check.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="Das ist ein schöner Tag"

User: The detect_for_translate_all_languages API also identified the language as German, confirming the initial result from quick_language_detector.

Assistant: Thought: Both the quick_language_detector and detect_for_translate_all_languages have consistently identified the language as German. This confirms my initial assessment. Since the task is simply to determine the language, and we've achieved this with high confidence, I will now proceed to finalize the task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of the phrase 'Das ist ein schöner Tag' is German."
