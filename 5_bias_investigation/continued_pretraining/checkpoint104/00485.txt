 Thought: The user has provided a Spanish sentence. My first step should be to detect its language accurately. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed for language detection and can also translate, but its primary purpose here is to identify the language. I'll pass the text 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?' to it.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the language is Spanish. This confirms my initial assessment. Now that I know the language, I can proceed to translate it if needed, or simply provide the language identification as the task requires.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the sentence 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?' is Spanish.
