 Thought: The user has provided a text, and the task is to identify its language. The most straightforward approach is to use a dedicated language detection tool. Given the options, `text_language_by_api_ninjas` seems appropriate for this initial step. I'll proceed with that.

Action: `text_language_by_api_ninjas`
Action Input: {'text': 'This is an example of English text'}

Assistant: Thought: The `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool is designed to detect the language from any input text. I've just submitted the text 'This is an example of English text' for analysis. I'll wait for the API response to determine the language.

Action: `text_language_by_api_ninjas`
Action Input: {'text': 'This is an example of English text'}

Assistant: Thought: The API has responded, indicating that the language of the text 'This is an example of English text' is English. This confirms my initial assumption. Since the task is to identify the language, and the result is clear, I can now proceed to give the final answer.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the text "This is an example of English text" is English.'}
