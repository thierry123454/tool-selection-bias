 Thought: The user has provided a text, and my initial task is to determine its language. I will use the "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector" function to analyze the input text and get a confidence score. This will give me a preliminary understanding of the language.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {'text': 'שלום, מה שלומך היום?'}
