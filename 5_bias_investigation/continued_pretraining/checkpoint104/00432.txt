 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a specific text. To determine this, I will use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function, which is designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code. This seems straightforward and should provide an accurate result.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: `text: 'Bonjour tout le monde'`

User: 
I get the result from `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`: 'fr'. This indicates that the text 'Bonjour tout le monde' is written in French.
