 Thought: The user has provided a short text in French. My initial action should be to detect its language using the available tools. Given the brevity and the specific nature of the text, I'll prioritize a quick and reliable detection method. I'll use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, which is designed to provide a confidence score, allowing me to assess the certainty of the detection.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: {"text": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function has successfully processed the input text. It has identified the language as French with a high confidence score. This is a strong indication that the text is indeed in French. My next step would be to confirm this detection using another tool, perhaps `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, to ensure consistency and accuracy, especially if the confidence score from the first tool is not absolute.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {"text": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has also identified the language as French. This consistent result across two different detection methods reinforces my confidence in the initial detection. Since the task is simply to detect the language, and I now have a clear and confident answer, I should proceed to provide the final result.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the provided text 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?' is French."}

Assistant: Thought: The task is now complete, and the final answer has been provided. I have used two different language detection tools to ensure the accuracy of the result, which is French. The `Finish` function has been called with the appropriate `return_type` and `final_answer`, indicating that the task is successfully concluded.
