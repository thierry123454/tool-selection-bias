 Thought: The user has provided a text in Russian. My first step is to confirm the language using one of the available language detection tools. I’ll try the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function for its simplicity and accuracy.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has successfully identified the language as 'russian'. This confirms that the text is indeed in Russian. Now, I can proceed with any further actions based on this detection, such as translating it or providing more context.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian."}
