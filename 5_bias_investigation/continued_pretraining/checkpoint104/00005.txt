 Thought: The user has provided a text in a language I don't immediately recognize. My first step is to identify the language of this text. I have several tools available for language detection, including `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`, and `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`. I'll start by using the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it's a general-purpose language detection tool.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?'

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
