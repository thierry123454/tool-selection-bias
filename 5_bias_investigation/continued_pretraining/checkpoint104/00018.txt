 Thought: The user has provided a specific phrase, "Das ist ein schöner Tag," and has asked for its language. My first step should be to identify the language of this input text. I have several language detection tools available, and I should choose the most straightforward one for this initial analysis.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {'text': 'Das ist ein schöner Tag'}

User: The API returned 'de' for the language. What does this mean?

Assistant: Thought: The API has successfully identified the language of the input text as 'de', which stands for German. This is a clear and definitive result. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and we have a confident detection, I can proceed to conclude the task.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the phrase "Das ist ein schöner Tag" is German (German language code: de).'}
