 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in a language that is not English. My first step is to determine the language using one of the available language detection tools. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function for its comprehensive language detection capabilities.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Hej, hur mår du?'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has successfully identified the language of the input text. The result indicates that the sentence is in Swedish. Now that I know the language, I can proceed with any further actions if needed, but for the initial task of identification, this is sufficient.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the sentence "Hej, hur mår du?" is Swedish.'
