 Thought: I need to detect the language of the input text 'Merhaba, nas覺ls覺n?'. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it's designed to detect the language of text, and it's a straightforward choice for this task. The text is quite short, but it should be sufficient for a reliable detection.

Action: `detect_for_translate_all_languages`

Action Input: `text: 'Merhaba, nas覺ls覺n?'`
