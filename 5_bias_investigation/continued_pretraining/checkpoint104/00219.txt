 Thought: The user has provided a short sentence, and my task is to identify its language. Given the brevity of the input, I should first consider using a tool that can quickly and reliably detect the language. The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` tool seems suitable for this initial analysis. I'll pass the sentence directly to it and observe the result.

Action: `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`
Action Input: `text: 'Hej, hur m책r du?'`

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has returned a result. I need to analyze the output to determine the detected language and its confidence score. This will help me decide if I can confidently proceed or if I need to consider alternative tools for verification.

Action: `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`
Action Input: `text: 'Hej, hur m책r du?'`

Assistant: Thought: The `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool has also provided a detection. I should now compare the results from both tools to ensure consistency. If both tools agree on the language, I can proceed. If there's a discrepancy, I might need to consider a more robust language detection method or confirm with the user.

Action: `detect_for_translate_v3`
Action Input: `text: 'Hej, hur m책r du?'`

Assistant: Thought: The `translate_v3` tool, which also includes a language detection capability, has confirmed the language. The consistency across these three tools strongly indicates that the language is indeed Swedish. Given this high confidence, I can now confidently provide the answer to the user.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: `return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the sentence "Hej, hur m책r du?" is Swedish. This is confirmed by multiple language detection tools, including API Ninjas Text Language, quick_language_detector, and translate_v3. These tools consistently identified the language as Swedish, providing a high degree of confidence in the result.'`
