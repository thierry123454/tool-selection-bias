 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in Spanish. My first step should be to confirm its language before attempting any translation or further processing. I’ll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function for this initial detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás hoy?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has returned 'es' as the detected language, which is correct for Spanish. This confirms the language of the input text. Now, I can proceed with the task, which is simply to detect the language, and I’ve successfully done that.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of 'Hola, ¿cómo estás hoy?' is Spanish (es)."}
