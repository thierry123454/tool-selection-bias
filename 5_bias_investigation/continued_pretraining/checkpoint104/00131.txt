 Thought: I need to detect the language of the given text. I have several options available, but I'll start with the most straightforward one, `what_s_language`, which directly detects the language. I'll pass the text to its subfunction `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` and see what it returns.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: `text="Het is een mooie dag vandaag."`

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` tool has just returned 'nl' with a high confidence score. This indicates that the text is in Dutch. However, I should verify this with another tool to ensure accuracy, especially since the text is quite short. I'll use `quick_language_detector` for a cross-check.

Action: `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`
Action Input: `text="Het is een mooie dag vandaag."`

Assistant: Thought: The `quick_language_detector` has also returned 'nl' with a confidence score of 0.98. This confirms my initial detection from `what_s_language`. The text is definitively in Dutch. Now, I should provide the final answer using the `Finish` function, as I believe I have successfully completed the task.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: `return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The text 'Het is een mooie dag vandaag.' is written in Dutch (language code: nl)."`
