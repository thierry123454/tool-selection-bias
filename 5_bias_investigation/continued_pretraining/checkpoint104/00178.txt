 Thought:
The user has provided a short text in Korean. My first step is to identify the language of this text. I have several language detection tools available, each with its own strengths. I'll start by using `detect_for_translate_all_languages` to get an initial detection. If its confidence score is high, I'll proceed. If not, I'll consider using `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` or `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` for a secondary check. My goal is to confirm the language accurately before proceeding with any translation or further processing.

Action:
Detect the language of the given text.

Action Input:
detect_for_translate_all_languages(text='안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?')

Human: Thought:
The initial detection by `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the text is likely Korean, with a high confidence score. This is a strong indication, but to ensure absolute certainty, I'll cross-verify this result using `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`. This will provide an additional layer of confirmation, especially useful for shorter texts where subtle cues might be missed by a single model.

Action:
Detect the language of the given text.

Action Input:
detect_language_for_quick_language_detector(text='안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?')

Assistant: Thought:
The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` also confirms that the text is Korean, with a very high confidence score. This consistent result across two different language detection tools gives me a high degree of certainty. Now that I know the text is in Korean, I can proceed with the task, which is to identify its language. The user's query is effectively answered, and I can now call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action:
Provide the final answer.

Action Input:
Finish(return_type='give_answer', final_answer='The language of the text "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?" is Korean.')

Human: Thought:
The `Finish` function has been called, indicating that the task is complete. The final answer provided is clear and concise, stating that the language of the text is Korean. This meets the requirement of providing enough information to the user. Since the task is now complete and the answer is satisfactory, there's no need for further processing or retries. I can now consider the task fully resolved.

Action:
No further action needed.

Action Input:
