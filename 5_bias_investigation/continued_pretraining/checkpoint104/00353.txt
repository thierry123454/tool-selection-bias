 Thought: The user has asked to detect the language of a specific text, which is 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'. This is a clear task for one of our language detection tools. The text appears to be in Latin, but I'll need to confirm this using the available functions. I'll start by trying the `what_s_language` function, which is specifically designed for this purpose.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: {'text': 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'}

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` function has returned the result. It indicates that the detected language is indeed Latin. This confirms my initial assessment. The task is now complete, and I have the language identified. I should now call the `Finish` function to provide this result.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of "Salve, quid agis hodie?" is Latin.'}
