 Thought: The user has provided a phrase in German. My first step should be to confirm the language using a reliable detection tool. I'll use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function for this.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: text="Das ist ein sch√∂ner Tag"

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
