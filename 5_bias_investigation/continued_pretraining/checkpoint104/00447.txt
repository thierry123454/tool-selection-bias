 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, and the task is to identify its language. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function to analyze the text.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text="Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function has returned a result. I need to evaluate the confidence score to determine if the detection is reliable.

Action: (No specific function call needed for evaluation; this is internal thought processing.)
