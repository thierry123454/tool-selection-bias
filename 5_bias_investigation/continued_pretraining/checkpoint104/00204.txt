 Thought: I need to identify the language of the given text. The text is "Hej, hur mår du idag?". Given its brevity and common usage, it's likely a Scandinavian language. I'll start by using the `what_s_language` tool, which is designed for this purpose. This will be my initial attempt to detect the language.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: 'Hej, hur mår du idag?'

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` tool has returned a result. I need to analyze its output to confirm the language. The tool is expected to return a language code. If it correctly identifies the language, I'll proceed. If there's any ambiguity or an error, I might try an alternative method.

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` tool has successfully identified the language as 'sv' (Swedish). This aligns with my initial assumption that the text is likely in Swedish, given the common phrases like "hur mår du" which translates to "how are you" in Swedish. Since I have a confident detection, I can now proceed to confirm this or move to the next step if needed.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: 'Hej, hur mår du idag?'

Assistant: Thought: I'm using the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` tool to cross-verify the language detection. This tool is known for its quick response and confidence score. It will provide an additional perspective on the language identification.

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` tool has confirmed the language as 'sv' with a high confidence score. This reinforces my previous detection from `what_s_language`. The consistency between the two tools gives me more confidence in the result.

Assistant: Thought: Now that I have confirmed the language is Swedish, I can consider the next steps. If the task involves translation or further processing, knowing the source language is crucial. However, since the task is simply to determine the language, I believe I have achieved the goal. I should now call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the text "Hej, hur mår du idag?" is Swedish. It has been confirmed by two different language detection tools: what_s_language and quick_language_detector, both identifying it as 'sv' with high confidence. This text is
