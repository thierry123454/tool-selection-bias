 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a specific sentence. I will first try to detect the language using one of the available language detection tools. I'll start with "what_s_language" as it seems straightforward for this purpose.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text='Ciao, come stai?'

Assistant: Thought: The API call for "what_s_language" has returned a result. I need to analyze this result to determine if it provides a clear language identification for the input text.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of 'Ciao, come stai?' is Italian."
