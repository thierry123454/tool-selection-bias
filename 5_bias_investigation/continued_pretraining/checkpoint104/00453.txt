 Thought: The user has provided a text 'Γειά σου, πώς είσαι?'. My first step is to determine the language of this text. Given that it appears to be in Greek, I will use the "Detect the language of a given text" tool, specifically the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction, to confirm this.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`

Action Input: `text: 'Γειά σου, πώς είσαι?'`

Assistant: Thought: The result from the language detection tool confirms that the text is indeed in Greek. Now, I need to ensure this detection is accurate and provide a clear, concise answer to the user. Since the task is complete, I will proceed to call the `Finish` function with the final answer.

Action: `Finish`

Action Input: `return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The text "Γειά σου, πώς είσαι?" is detected as Greek by the language detection tool.'`
