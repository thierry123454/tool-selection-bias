 Thought: The user has provided a short text snippet that appears to be in Korean. My first step should be to confirm the language using one of the available tools. Given the nature of the input, I'll prioritize using the most straightforward and reliable method for language detection.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다."}

Assistant: Thought: The quick_language_detector has returned a result. I need to analyze the output to confirm the detected language and its confidence score. This will guide my next steps, whether to proceed with translation or to confirm the language for other purposes.

Action: (No specific action needed; analyze the result of quick_language_detector)

Assistant: Thought: The quick_language_detector has identified the text as Korean with a high confidence score. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, if the task involves translation, I can proceed with translating the text into another language. If the task is simply to identify the language, I can now confidently state the language.

Action: translate_v3

Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.", "target_language": "en"}

Assistant: Thought: The translation from Korean to English using translate_v3 has been completed. I now have the translated text. If the user's original task was solely about language detection, I can now confirm the language. If it was a translation task, the translation is now available.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.' is Korean. Its English translation is 'Hello, nice to meet you.'"}

Assistant: Thought: The task is complete. I have successfully detected the language and provided a translation, if applicable. The final answer is now ready to be presented to the user.
