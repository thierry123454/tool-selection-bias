 Thought: The user has provided a text, and my initial task is to determine its language. Given the nature of the input, which appears to be Korean, I will first attempt to confirm this using the available language detection tools. I will prioritize using the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is a direct and reliable method for language detection within the `translate_all_languages` API. If it provides a clear result, I will proceed. If not, I will consider alternative tools like `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` or `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` for confirmation.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다'
