 Thought: The user has provided a text and explicitly asked for its language. To determine this, I should first detect the language using one of the available language detection tools. Given the prompt, it's clear that the user expects a direct answer, so I'll proceed with the most straightforward approach.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {"text": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?"}

After the call: The API returns 'fr' with a high confidence score.

Thought: The API has identified the text as French. This is a definitive result, and I can now proceed to confirm or provide the answer. Since this is a direct detection, I don't need to cross-check with other tools unless there's ambiguity, but in this case, the confidence is strong.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The text 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?' is written in French."}

After the call: The task is complete, and the final answer is ready to be shown to the user.
