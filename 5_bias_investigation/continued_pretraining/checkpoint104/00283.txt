 Thought: The user has provided a text that appears to be in Hebrew. To confirm, I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to detect the language. This function is designed to identify the language of any given text, which is exactly what we need here. I will feed the text 'שלום, מה שלומך היום?' into it.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {
  "text": "שלום, מה שלומך היום?"
}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has successfully identified the language. The result indicates that the text is indeed in Hebrew. This confirms our initial assumption. Now that we know the language, we can proceed with any translation or further processing if required. For now, I will simply confirm the detection and prepare to call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the text 'שלום, מה שלומך היום?' is Hebrew."
}
