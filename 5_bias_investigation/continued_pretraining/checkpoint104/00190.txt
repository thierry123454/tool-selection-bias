 Thought: The user has provided a phrase, and my first step should be to determine its language. Given the available tools, the most direct and reliable method for this initial detection is to use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function. This tool is specifically designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code, which is exactly what we need. It's a straightforward and efficient way to get the language identification before we consider translation or further processing.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: text: 'Мне нравится читать книги.'

Assistant: Thought: The output from `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` will provide the detected language code. This code is crucial as it will inform the subsequent steps, such as routing the text to the appropriate translation service or identifying the correct language for further analysis. If the detection is accurate, we can proceed with confidence. If there's an error or an unexpected result, we'll need to consider alternative strategies or flag it for manual review.

Assistant: Thought: Assuming the language detection is successful, the next step would be to confirm the language or use it to guide a translation attempt. However, since the user's primary request was simply to find out the language, we can proceed to wrap up the task by providing the detected language. This avoids unnecessary translation steps and directly addresses the user's query. It's important to ensure that the detected language is clear and unambiguous to the user.
