 Thought: The user has provided a text that appears to be in Korean. To confirm this, I will use the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool, which is specifically designed to detect the language from any input text. This will be my first step to ascertain the language definitively.

Action: `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`

Action Input: text: '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?'

User: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has successfully identified the language as Korean.

Assistant: Thought: The API has confirmed that the text is indeed Korean. My next step is to ensure that the translation process, if needed, is correctly initiated. However, since the task is simply to determine the language, I can now proceed to finalize the result.

Action: `Finish`

Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the text "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?" is Korean.'
