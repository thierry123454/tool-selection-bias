 Thought: The user has provided a short text string, and the task is to determine its language. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function to analyze the input and get a confidence score for the detected language. This should give me a clear indication of what language the text is in.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {
  "text": "Это пример текста."
}

Assistant: Thought: I've just received the result from the language detection. The `quick_language_detector` has identified the language, but I need to confirm its accuracy, especially given the short nature of the input. If the confidence score is high, I can proceed. If not, I might consider using an alternative method to ensure correctness.

Action: If the confidence score from `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` is high, then:
  1. Confirm the language.
  2. If the language is not English, I might consider using `translate_all_languages` to translate it to English for better understanding, or simply provide the detected language code. If it's English, I can proceed with the assumption that the text is in English.

Action: If the confidence score is low or the language is ambiguous, then:
  1. I will try `detect_for_translate_all_languages` as a secondary check.
  2. If both `quick_language_detector` and `translate_all_languages` agree, I will proceed with the detected language.
  3. If there's still ambiguity, I will consider using `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` as a fallback.

Action Input: {
  "text": "Это пример текста."
}

Assistant: Thought: After the initial detection, the `quick_language_detector` identified the text as Russian with a high confidence score. This aligns with my expectation, as the text contains Cyrillic characters and common Russian words. The confidence score is sufficiently high, so I can proceed with the conclusion that the language is Russian.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the message 'Это пример текста.' is Russian."
}
