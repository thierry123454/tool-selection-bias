 Thought: The user has provided a specific text and asked for its language. I need to determine the language of "Dit is een testzin in het Nederlands." I will first attempt to use the `detect_language_for_translate_v3` function, as it is designed for language detection and is a direct candidate for this task. If it fails or returns an unexpected result, I will consider alternative methods.

Action: `detect_language_for_translate_v3`
Action Input: {"text": "Dit is een testzin in het Nederlands"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_translate_v3` function has returned a result. I need to interpret this result to determine the language. If it's accurate, I can proceed to confirm it.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Dit is een testzin in het Nederlands' is Dutch (Nederlands)."}

User: 
Ah, that's what I thought! Thanks. Now, could you also tell me the language of this one: 'Ceci est un test en français'?

Assistant: Thought: The user has provided another text, 'Ceci est un test en français,' and asked for its language. I will use the `detect_language_for_translate_v3` function again, as it is reliable for language detection.

Action: `detect_language_for_translate_v3`
Action Input: {"text": "Ceci est un test en français"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_translate_v3` function has returned a result. I need to verify this result to ensure accuracy.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Ceci est un test en français' is French."}

User: 
Great! One more, please: 'Es ist ein Test in Deutsch'?

Assistant: Thought: The user has provided yet another text, 'Es ist ein Test in Deutsch,' and asked for its language. I will again use the `detect_language_for_translate_v3` function, as it is the most straightforward tool for this task.

Action: `detect_language_for_translate_v3`
Action Input: {"text": "Es ist ein Test in Deutsch"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_translate_v3` function has returned a result. I need to confirm this result to ensure it's correct.
