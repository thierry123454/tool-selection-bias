 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and the task is to detect its language. I’ll start by using the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` tool, which is designed to determine the language with a confidence score. This seems like a straightforward initial step.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {'text': 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` tool has returned a result. I’ll analyze the output to determine the language and its confidence score. If the confidence is high, I can proceed with certainty. If not, I might consider alternative tools or methods.

Action: analyze_result
Action Input: {'result': 'Spanish;0.98'}
