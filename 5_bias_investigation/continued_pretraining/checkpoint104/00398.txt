 Thought: I need to determine the language of the given text. I have several tools available for language detection. The text provided is 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?'. This appears to be in a non-Latin script, so I should prioritize tools that are robust for such inputs. I'll first try the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool, which is a general-purpose language detector.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?'

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint is returning a result. It indicates the language is Hindi. This is a confident detection, so I can proceed to confirm and then provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The text 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं आज?' is written in Hindi.
