 Thought: The user has provided a Latin phrase, and my task is to detect its language. I'll first try to use one of the language detection tools available. Given the simplicity of the input, I'll start with the most straightforward option, `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, as it's well-documented and should provide a quick result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'

Assistant: Thought: The API has returned a language code. I need to interpret this result and decide how to proceed. If it's a valid language, I can move forward. If not, I might need to try an alternative method.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of 'Salve, quid agis hodie?' is detected as Latin. This is a classic example of a phrase that would be understood by anyone familiar with the language of the ancient Roman Empire.
