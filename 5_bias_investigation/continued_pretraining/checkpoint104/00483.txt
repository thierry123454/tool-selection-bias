 Thought: The user has provided a short text snippet, and my task is to identify its language. Given the brevity, I'll consider using a tool that can detect language with reasonable accuracy even from short inputs. I'll opt for the "what_s_language" function, specifically its subfunction "languagedetection_for_what_s_language", which is designed to detect the language of a given text. This should be a straightforward initial step.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: 'Ciao, come stai oggi?'
After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
