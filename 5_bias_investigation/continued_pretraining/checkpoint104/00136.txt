 Thought: The user has provided a text, and the task is to determine its language. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is designed to detect the language of any given text. This function is straightforward and should provide an accurate result. Since the text is in Arabic, it should be correctly identified.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="مرحبا كيف حالك"
