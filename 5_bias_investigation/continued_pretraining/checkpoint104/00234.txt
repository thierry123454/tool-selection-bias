 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in Spanish. My first step is to accurately detect the language using the available tools. Given the context, the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool seems suitable for this initial detection. I'll proceed with that.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {'text': 'Hola, ¿cómo estás hoy?'}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has returned the language as Spanish. This confirms my initial assumption. Now that I have the language, I can proceed with any further actions if needed, but for the immediate task of detection, this is sufficient. I should now consider whether to provide the detected language directly or if there's more to do.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the sentence "Hola, ¿cómo estás hoy?" is Spanish.'}
