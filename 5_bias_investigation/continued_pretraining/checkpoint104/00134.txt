 Thought: The user has provided a phrase, and my primary goal is to accurately determine its language. Given the variety of tools available, I need to select the most appropriate one for this specific task. The phrase 'Das ist ein schöner Tag' is in German, but I need to confirm this programmatically. I will consider using quick_language_detector or translate_all_languages, as they are designed for language detection. For precision, I might lean towards quick_language_detector, which is specifically designed for this purpose.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag"}

Assistant: Thought: The API call to quick_language_detector has been made. I will now process the response to determine the detected language and its confidence score. This will guide my next steps, whether it's confirming the language or considering an alternative approach if the confidence is low.
