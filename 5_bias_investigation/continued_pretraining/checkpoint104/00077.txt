 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a specific sentence. To do this, I will first consider the available tools. The `what_s_language` tool seems most directly applicable, as it is designed to detect the language of a given text. I will use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction for this purpose. The input text is 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'. This is a clear, short phrase, so it should be straightforward for the tool to analyze.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: text: 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'

After the call, I will receive the detected language code from the tool.
