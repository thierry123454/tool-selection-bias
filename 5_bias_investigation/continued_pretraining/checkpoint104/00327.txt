 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, and my first step is to detect its language. I'll use the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool for this. I'll pass the phrase 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' as the input to the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` subfunction.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'Olá, tudo bem com você?'

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint is the one I'll be calling. I'll send the phrase 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' to detect its language. Once I get the result, I'll analyze it to confirm the language.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'Olá, tudo bem com você?'

Assistant: Thought: The API has returned the language. I'll check the result to see if it correctly identifies the language of 'Olá, tudo bem com você?'. If it's accurate, I'll proceed to confirm it; if not, I might need to try an alternative method.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'Olá, tudo bem com você?'

Assistant: Thought: The result from the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint indicates that the language is Portuguese. This seems accurate, as 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' is a common greeting in Portuguese. I'll confirm this by cross-referencing with other language detection tools if needed, but for now, I'm fairly confident.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'Olá, tudo bem com você?'

Assistant: Thought: The language detection is confirmed as Portuguese. Now, I need to provide the final answer to the user, indicating that the language of 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' is Portuguese. I'll proceed to call the `Finish` function with the appropriate parameters.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of "Olá, tudo bem com você?" is Portuguese.'
