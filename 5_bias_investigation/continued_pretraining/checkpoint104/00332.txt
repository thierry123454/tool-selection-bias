 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Arabic. My initial task is to accurately identify its language. Given the available tools, I will first attempt to detect the language using the most straightforward and efficient method available. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed for language detection and is likely to provide a quick and reliable result for this simple input. If it fails or if I need more confidence, I will consider using alternative detection methods.

Action: `detect_for_translate_all_languages`

Action Input: `text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'`

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has returned a result indicating that the language is Arabic. This is a confident detection, and it aligns with my initial expectation. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and I have a clear answer, I can proceed to finalize this.

Action: `Finish`

Action Input: `return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of "مرحبا كيف حالك؟" is Arabic.'`
