 Thought: I need to determine the language of the input text. I have several language detection tools available, including `what_s_language`, `quick_language_detector`, and `text_language_by_api_ninjas`. I'll start with the simplest one, `what_s_language`, which is designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code. This should be a straightforward initial attempt.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag für einen Spaziergang."}

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` tool has provided a detection. I need to review the result to confirm its accuracy and proceed accordingly. If the detection is confident and correct, I can move forward. If not, I might consider alternative methods or retry with different parameters.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag für einen Spaziergang."}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` tool has also provided a detection. I will compare its output with the previous result from `what_s_language` to ensure consistency. If both tools agree, I can be more confident in the language identification. If they differ, I might need to investigate further or use a third tool.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag für einen Spaziergang."}

Assistant: Thought: The `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool has now provided its detection. I will cross-reference all three results to identify the most consistent and probable language. Given that all three tools are designed for language detection, their agreement will significantly boost my confidence in the final answer.

Action: detect_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "Das ist ein schöner Tag für einen Spaziergang."}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_v3` tool has also confirmed the language. The consistency across all tools is encouraging. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and I have multiple confirmations, I can now provide the final answer. I will also call the `Finish` function to wrap up this task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the input text 'Das ist ein schöner Tag für einen Spaziergang.' is German."}
