 Thought: The user has provided a text that appears to be in Arabic. My first step is to confirm this using one of the available language detection tools. I'll start with the `what_s_language` function, which is designed to detect the language of a given text.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` function is now processing the text. I'll wait for its result before deciding my next step.

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` function has returned a result. It indicates that the language is indeed Arabic. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, I need to decide if this is sufficient for the user's request or if further processing is needed.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the text "مرحبا كيف حالك؟" has been detected as Arabic by the `what_s_language` function. This confirms that the text is in Arabic, as expected.'
