 Thought: The user has requested to identify the language of a specific piece of text. Given the available tools, I should first detect the language using one of the language detection APIs. The text provided is clearly in English, but I need to confirm this programmatically. I'll start by using one of the language detection functions.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {
  "text": "This is an example of English text."
}

Assistant: Thought: The API has returned the detected language. I need to analyze the result to confirm the language is indeed English.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the text 'This is an example of English text' has been detected as English by the API."
}
