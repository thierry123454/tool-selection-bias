 Thought: The user has provided a text string, and the task is to identify its language. To do this effectively, I need to determine the most suitable tool for language detection, considering accuracy and efficiency.

Action: I will use the "text_language_by_api_ninjas" tool, which is specifically designed to detect the language from any input text. This seems like a straightforward and reliable choice for this initial detection.

Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

Assistant: Thought: The tool "text_language_by_api_ninjas" has been called with the input text. I await the result to determine the language.

Assistant: Thought: The result from "text_language_by_api_ninjas" indicates the detected language is Russian. This is a clear and confident identification, which is a good sign for proceeding.

Action: The language is identified as Russian. The next step would be to confirm this detection, perhaps by trying another tool if available, or moving forward with the task. However, given the confidence of the initial detection, I will proceed.

Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

Action: I will now confirm the language detection by using a different tool, "what_s_language", to cross-verify the result. This adds an extra layer of reliability.

Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

Assistant: Thought: The "what_s_language" tool has also identified the text as Russian, confirming the initial detection from "text_language_by_api_ninjas". This consistency strengthens my confidence in the result.

Action: With two independent tools confirming the language is Russian, I can now confidently proceed with the task, which was to identify the language of the provided text.

Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

Action: I will now call the "Finish" function to provide the final answer, as the task of identifying the language has been successfully completed.

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian."}

Assistant: Thought: The "Finish" function has been called with the final answer. This concludes the task, and the user will receive the information that the language of the provided text is Russian.
