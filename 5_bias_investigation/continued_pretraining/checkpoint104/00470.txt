 Thought: The user has provided a text, and my primary objective is to determine its language. I will first attempt to use a reliable and straightforward method, specifically the `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` tool, which is designed for quick and accurate language identification. This tool is expected to provide a direct language code, making it ideal for this initial detection phase.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: text: 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?'

Assistant: Thought: The `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` tool has provided a language code. If the result is confident and matches my expectations, I will proceed to confirm it. If there's any ambiguity or an unexpected result, I will consider alternative methods to ensure accuracy.

Action: I will now examine the result from `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` to confirm the detected language. If it's clear, I will proceed to confirm it. If not, I will explore other options.

Assistant: Thought: The result from `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` indicates that the text is in French. This is a strong indication, but I will still verify it using another tool to ensure maximum confidence.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool also confirms that the text is in French. This dual confirmation strengthens my confidence in the detection. Now, I need to ensure that the language detection is consistent across all my tools.

Action: I will cross-reference the detection with `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` to ensure consistency.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?'

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tool also identifies the text as French. The consistent results across all three primary language detection tools (`fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3`, `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, and `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`) provide a high degree of certainty that the text is indeed in French.

Action: Given the consistent and confident results from multiple reliable language detection tools, I can now confidently state the language of the provided text.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the text "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?" is French. All primary
