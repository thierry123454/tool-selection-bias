 Thought: The user has provided a text that appears to be in Russian. My first step should be to confirm the language using one of the available language detection tools. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function for this initial detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {'text': 'Привет, как дела?'}
