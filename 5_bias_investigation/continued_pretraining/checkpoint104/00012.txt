 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, and my immediate goal is to determine its language. Given the available tools, I can leverage the language detection capabilities of various APIs. Since the input is a single phrase, I might consider using a straightforward language detection tool. The `what_s_language` function, which internally uses `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, seems like a direct fit for this initial step. I will attempt to detect the language using this tool.

Action: what_s_language

Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك'

Assistant: Thought: I have now received the result from the language detection. The API has identified the language, and I can now proceed with the next steps, which might involve confirming the language or using it for further processing if needed. For now, I will simply confirm the detected language and prepare to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of "مرحبا كيف حالك" is Arabic. It was detected by the `what_s_language` tool, which internally uses the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction. This confirms that the text is indeed in Arabic, a language widely spoken across the Middle East and North Africa.
