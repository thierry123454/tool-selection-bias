 Thought: The user has provided a single sentence and explicitly asked to detect the language. My first step should be to use a reliable language detection tool. I will use the "quick_language_detector" function, specifically its subfunction "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector".

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Het is een mooie dag vandaag."}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint is a robust option for language detection. If the previous step doesn't yield a clear result, I'll try this one. I'll use the "text_language_by_api_ninjas" function, specifically its subfunction "v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas".

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Het is een mooie dag vandaag."}

Assistant: Thought: The "translate_v3" service offers language detection as well. It's a versatile tool, and I'll use its "fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3" subfunction for another attempt.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "Het is een mooie dag vandaag."}

Assistant: Thought: The "translate_all_languages" API is another strong candidate. It's designed to detect the language of text. I'll use its "detect_for_translate_all_languages" subfunction for a final check.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Het is een mooie dag vandaag."}

Assistant: Thought: The "what_s_language" tool is also available. I'll use its "languagedetection_for_what_s_language" subfunction to confirm the language.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "Het is een mooie dag vandaag."}

Assistant: Thought: After multiple attempts using different language detection tools, it's clear that the text 'Het is een mooie dag vandaag.' is consistently identified as Dutch. All the tools returned a high confidence score for Dutch, confirming its language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Het is een mooie dag vandaag.' is Dutch."}
