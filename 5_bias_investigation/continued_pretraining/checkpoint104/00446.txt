 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a specific phrase, "Olá, tudo bem?". To determine this, I will first use a reliable language detection tool. Given the availability of several options, I will prioritize the one that is most likely to provide an accurate and quick result for this particular input. The text is quite short, so I need to ensure the tool can handle brevity effectively. I'll proceed with the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is designed to detect the language of any given text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the language is Portuguese. This is a straightforward and confident detection, which aligns with my expectations for such a common phrase. Since the task was to detect the language and I have a clear answer, I will now proceed to provide the final result using the `Finish` function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language detected in the phrase 'Olá, tudo bem?' is Portuguese."}
