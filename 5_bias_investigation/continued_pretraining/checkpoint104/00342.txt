 Thought: The user has asked to determine the language of the phrase 'Merhaba, nasılsın?'. This seems straightforward, but to ensure accuracy, especially for less common languages, I should consider using a reliable language detection tool. Before making a direct call, I should confirm that the tool is ready to use and that it correctly identifies the language based on the input. My plan is to use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is specifically designed for language detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Merhaba, nasılsın?'
Result: The API returns 'tr' with a high confidence score, indicating that the language is Turkish.

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` clearly indicates that 'Merhaba, nasılsın?' is in Turkish. This is a definitive answer. I can now proceed to inform the user of this result. Before finalizing, I should double-check if there are any other tools that might offer a different perspective or confirm this, but given the clarity of the result, it seems unnecessary.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The phrase 'Merhaba, nasılsın?' is written in Turkish.
