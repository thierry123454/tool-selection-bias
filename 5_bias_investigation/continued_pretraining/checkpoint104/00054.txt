 Thought: The user has asked to identify the language of a specific sentence. To do this, I'll first try to detect the language using the available tools. I'll start by using the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed to detect the language of any given text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Olá, tudo bem com você?'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has successfully identified the language. It returned 'pt' (Portuguese). This confirms that the input text is in Portuguese. My next step would be to verify this result or proceed with a translation if needed, but since the task is simply to identify the language, I can now provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the sentence "Olá, tudo bem com você?" is Portuguese (pt).'
