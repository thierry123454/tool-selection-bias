 Thought: The user has provided a specific phrase, 'Das ist ein schöner Tag', and explicitly requested its language. My first step should be to confirm the language using the available tools. Given the phrase contains German words, it's likely German, but I should verify this systematically using the language detection subfunctions.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Das ist ein schöner Tag'

User: The API responded with 'de' for the language code.

Assistant: Thought: The API has confirmed that the language of 'Das ist ein schöner Tag' is German (de). This aligns with my initial hypothesis. To ensure accuracy, I should also cross-check with other language detection tools, especially if the input was ambiguous or very short. However, given the clear German words, the detection seems robust.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of the phrase 'Das ist ein schöner Tag' is German (de)."
