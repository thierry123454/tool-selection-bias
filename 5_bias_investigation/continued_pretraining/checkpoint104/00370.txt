 Thought: The user has provided a text in Spanish. My goal is to confirm the language using the available tools and then provide a clear answer. I'll start by using the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function to detect the language. This tool is designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code, which should be straightforward for this input.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`

Action Input: `text: '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?'`

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function has successfully detected the language. The result indicates that the text is indeed in Spanish. This confirms my initial assessment. The next step is to ensure that the user understands the language has been correctly identified. I will proceed with providing a clear answer.

Action: `Finish`

Action Input: `return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the text "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?" is Spanish.'`
