 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase. My first step is to determine its language. I'll use the "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector" tool, which is designed to analyze text and return a language with a confidence score. This will give me a reliable initial assessment.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: The result from "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector" will tell me the language of the input text. If the confidence score is high, I can proceed with confidence. If it's low, I might need to try another method or confirm with the user.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: Now that I have results from two different language detection tools, I'll compare their outputs. If they agree, I'll have a strong indication of the language. If they differ, I'll consider the confidence scores and potentially use a third tool, "detect_for_translate_v3", which also offers language detection, to make a final decision.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: After receiving results from all three language detection tools, I can now confidently determine the language of the text. The tools consistently identified it as Italian with high confidence. This means the user's query was in Italian, and I can now proceed to provide a relevant response or translate if needed.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Ciao, come stai?' is Italian."}
