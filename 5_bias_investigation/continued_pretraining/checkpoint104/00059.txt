 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a specific phrase. To determine this, I can use the language detection tools available. It's important to first detect the language before attempting any translation, as the `translate_all_languages` tool requires the source language to be specified. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to identify the language. If it's not clear, I might also try `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` or `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` for confirmation.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Je suis très heureux'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has processed the input text 'Je suis très heureux'. Based on the result, I can now confirm the language. If the result is clear, I can proceed with the next steps. If there's any ambiguity, I might consider using another detection method for a higher confidence score.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The phrase "Je suis très heureux" is in French. This detection was performed using the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool, which identified the language based on the input text provided by the user. If you need further assistance or a translation, please let me know!'
