 Thought: The user has provided a phrase that appears to be in Latin. To confirm the language with certainty, I should use a reliable language detection tool. Given the options, I'll opt for the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, as it provides a confidence score, which will be useful for validation. I'll feed the phrase 'Salve, quid agis?' into this tool.
