 Thought: The user has asked about the language of the phrase 'Merhaba, nasılsın?'. I need to determine the language accurately. Given the simplicity and directness of the request, I'll first attempt to use a straightforward language detection tool that can quickly identify the language without requiring extensive context. I'll consider using the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function, as it is designed specifically for detecting the language of a given text. This seems like the most efficient approach for a single, short phrase.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: {'text': 'Merhaba, nasılsın?'}

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function has returned the detected language. I need to analyze its output to confirm the language of the input text. If it correctly identifies the language, I can proceed with confidence. If there's any ambiguity or an unexpected result, I might consider alternative methods or a more detailed analysis. For now, I'll proceed with the result.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of "Merhaba, nasılsın?" is Turkish.'}
