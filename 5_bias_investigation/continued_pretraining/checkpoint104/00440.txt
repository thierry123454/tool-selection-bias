 Thought: The user has provided a single sentence in French. My immediate task is to accurately detect its language. Since we have several language detection tools available, I'll prioritize the one that is most straightforward for this specific task. The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function is designed for language detection, and it’s quite reliable. I'll use it to determine the language of the input text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has processed the input text. I need to analyze the result to confirm the detected language. If the detection is clear and confident, I can proceed with the translation or further processing. If there's any ambiguity, I might consider alternative methods or confirm with the user. For now, I'll proceed with the detected language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui"}

Assistant: Thought: The result from the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function indicates that the language of "Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui" is French. This is a clear and confident detection. Now that I know the language, I can proceed with any subsequent steps, such as translation or further analysis, if required. For this specific task, the detection itself is the primary goal, so I can now conclude.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui' is French."}
