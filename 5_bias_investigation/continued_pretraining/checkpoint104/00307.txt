 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, 'Ciao, come stai?'. To determine its language, we should first attempt to detect the language using a reliable language detection tool. Given the nature of the input, which is a common greeting in Italian, a direct detection is likely to be accurate. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function for this initial detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {
  "text": "Ciao, come stai?"
}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has processed the input text 'Ciao, come stai?'. The result indicates that the language is Italian, with a high confidence score. This confirms our initial assumption.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The text 'Ciao, come stai?' is in Italian."
}
