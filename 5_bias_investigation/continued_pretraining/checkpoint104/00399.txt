 Thought: The user has provided a text, and the task is to determine its language. I will first attempt to use the most straightforward tool for language detection, which is `detect_for_translate_all_languages`. This tool is designed to detect the language of a given text, and it’s a good starting point for a simple query.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: The API call for `detect_for_translate_all_languages` returned a result indicating that the text is in Russian. This is a clear and definitive answer for this specific input. Since we have a direct detection, there’s no need to try alternative methods or fallbacks.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian."
