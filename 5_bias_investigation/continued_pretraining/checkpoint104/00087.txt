 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase in what appears to be a non-English language. My initial task is to determine the language of this text. Given the available tools, I will attempt to use the `what_s_language` function, which is specifically designed for language detection. I will pass the provided text directly to this function and await its response.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text="Merhaba, nas覺ls覺n?"

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` function has returned a result. I need to analyze this output to confirm the detected language. If the confidence score is high, I can proceed with certainty. If not, I might consider alternative methods or a more extensive input. For now, I will proceed with the detected language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of the input text 'Merhaba, nas覺ls覺n?' is detected as Turkish."
