 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase. My first step is to determine the language of this input. Given that it's a common greeting, I'll use a dedicated language detection tool. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is specifically designed for this task and is expected to provide a reliable result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Hej, hur mår du idag?"}

Assistant: Thought: The result from the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function indicates that the language of the input text is "Danish". This is a clear and confident detection. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and we've achieved that, I can now proceed to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of 'Hej, hur mår du idag?' is Danish."}
