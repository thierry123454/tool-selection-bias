 Thought: The user has provided a sentence that appears to be in Latin. My primary goal is to confirm the language definitively. Given the context, I should leverage a reliable language detection tool. I will prioritize using the "what_s_language" function, specifically its subfunction "languagedetection_for_what_s_language", as it is designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code. This will provide a clear and concise answer.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'
