 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and the task is to determine its language. The text is 'Ciao, come stai?'. Given its brevity, I need to use a reliable language detection tool. I should try the 'what_s_language' function, which is designed to detect the language of a given text.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text='Ciao, come stai?'

Assistant: Thought: The function call for 'what_s_language' has been made. Now, I await the result to see which language is detected.

Assistant: Thought: The result indicates that the language is Italian. This seems accurate given the text 'Ciao, come stai?'. The task is now complete, and I have identified the language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type='give_answer', final_answer='The language of the text "Ciao, come stai?" is Italian.'
