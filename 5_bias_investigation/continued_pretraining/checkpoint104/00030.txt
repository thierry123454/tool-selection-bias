 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in Spanish. My initial step should be to confirm the language using a reliable detection tool. Given the options, "what_s_language" seems straightforward for this purpose. I'll proceed with that.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text="Hola, ¿cómo estás hoy?"

Assistant: Thought: The tool has successfully identified the language. I now have the detected language code. The next step is to confirm if this is indeed Spanish, as the user's input strongly suggests it. I can cross-check with another tool if needed, but for now, I'll proceed with the confidence from "what_s_language".

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of the sentence 'Hola, ¿cómo estás hoy?' is Spanish."
