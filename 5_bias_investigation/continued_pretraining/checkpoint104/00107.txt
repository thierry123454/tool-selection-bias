 Thought: The user has provided a text that appears to be in Russian. My first step is to confirm this using a reliable language detection tool. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function to analyze the text.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: {'text': 'Это пример текста на русском языке'}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function has successfully processed the text. The result indicates that the language is indeed Russian, with a high confidence score. This confirms my initial assessment.
