 Thought: The user has provided a phrase that appears to be in Greek. My first step should be to confirm this using one of the available language detection tools. I'll start with `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` to get an initial assessment.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: 'Είναι μια όμορφη μέρα.'

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
