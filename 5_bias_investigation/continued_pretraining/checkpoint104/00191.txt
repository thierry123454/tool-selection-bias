 Thought: The user has provided a message, and my primary goal is to identify its language. Given the available tools, I should first confirm the language before considering any translation. The most direct approach would be to use a dedicated language detection tool. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to analyze the input text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Это пример текста.'

User: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint detected the language as 'ru' with a confidence score of 0.9999999999999999.

Assistant: Thought: The API has successfully identified the language as Russian with near-perfect confidence. This confirms that the input text is indeed in Russian. Since the task is simply to identify the language, I have achieved the objective. Before finalizing, I should ensure that no further steps are necessary, such as translation, which is not explicitly requested here. However, the user might want to proceed with translation if they confirm the language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: "The language of the provided text 'Это пример текста.' is Russian (code: 'ru')."

User: (No further input, indicating the task is complete.)

Assistant: Thought: The task has been successfully completed by identifying the language of the provided text. I have called the `Finish` function with the "give_answer" parameter, ensuring that the final answer is clearly conveyed to the user. No further action is required.
