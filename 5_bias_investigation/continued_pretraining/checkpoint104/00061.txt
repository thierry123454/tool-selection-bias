 Thought: The user has provided a phrase that appears to be a mix of two languages. My first step is to identify the primary language of the input. I will use the text_language_by_api_ninjas function to detect the language. This tool is designed to detect the language from any input text, which seems ideal for this initial analysis.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?'

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has returned a result. I need to analyze the output to determine the detected language. Once I have this information, I can proceed with the next steps.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the input phrase "नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?" has been detected as Hindi. This tool, specifically the "v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas" function, accurately identified the language from the provided text. Further analysis or translation could proceed based on this detection. See more info at https://api-ninjas.com/api/textlanguage for more details on this capability.'}
