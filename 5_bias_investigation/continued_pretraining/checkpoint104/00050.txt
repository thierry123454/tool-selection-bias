 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in a language I'm not immediately familiar with. My first step should be to identify the language of this input. I have several tools available for language detection, and I'll start by using the "quick_language_detector" tool, which is designed to determine the language with a confidence score. This will give me a quick initial assessment.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: text: 'Merhaba, bugün nasılsın?'

Assistant: Thought: The result from the quick_language_detector indicates that the text is in a language with a high confidence score, but it doesn't explicitly name the language. To get a more precise identification, I'll use the "text_language_by_api_ninjas" tool, which is specifically designed to detect the language from any input text. This should provide a clearer answer.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas

Action Input: text: 'Merhaba, bugün nasılsın?'

Assistant: Thought: The "text_language_by_api_ninjas" tool has successfully identified the language. It confirms that the text is indeed in Turkish. This aligns with my initial suspicion based on the content of the sentence. Now that I have the language, I can confirm that the user's query has been answered.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the sentence "Merhaba, bugün nasılsın?" is Turkish.'
