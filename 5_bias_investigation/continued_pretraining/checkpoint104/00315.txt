 Thought: The user has provided a text in Greek. My first step should be to confirm the language using one of the language detection tools. I will use the `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function for this initial check.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: text: 'Γειά σου, πώς είσαι;'

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
