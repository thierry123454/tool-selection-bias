 Thought: The user has provided a phrase in Greek, and my task is to determine its language accurately. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed to detect the language of any input text. This function is straightforward and should provide a reliable result.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Είναι μια όμορφη μέρα."}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has identified the language. I will now proceed to confirm the accuracy and prepare the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the phrase 'Είναι μια όμορφη μέρα.' is Greek."}
