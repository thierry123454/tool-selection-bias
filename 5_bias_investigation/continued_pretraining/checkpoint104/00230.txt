 Thought: The user has provided a short text snippet, and my primary task is to determine its language. Given the brevity, I'll first attempt to detect the language using the available tools, starting with the most straightforward one.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
