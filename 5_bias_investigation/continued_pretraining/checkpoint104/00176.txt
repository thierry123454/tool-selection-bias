Action Input: {"text": "مرحبا كيف حالك؟"}

Assistant: Thought: The `quick_language_detector` has returned a result. I need to check the language and confidence score. If the confidence is high, I can proceed. If not, I might need to try another method.

Assistant: Thought: After analyzing the result, I confirm it's Arabic with a high confidence score. This means I can confidently proceed with the task, which was to detect the language of the given text.
