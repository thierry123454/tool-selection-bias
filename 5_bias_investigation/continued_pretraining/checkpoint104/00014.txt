 Thought: The user has provided a text in Hebrew. My first task is to confirm the language using the available tools. I'll use the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool, specifically its subfunction `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`, to detect the language.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'שלום, מה שלומך היום?'

Assistant: Thought: I've just received the result from the `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool. It correctly identified the language as Hebrew. Now, I need to confirm this detection using another tool to ensure accuracy, as sometimes false positives can occur.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'שלום, מה שלומך היום?'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool also identified the language as Hebrew, which aligns with the previous detection. This gives me high confidence in the result. Now, I need to decide on the next step. Since the task is to detect the language, and I've successfully done that, I should now provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the provided text 'שלום, מה שלומך היום?' is Hebrew.
