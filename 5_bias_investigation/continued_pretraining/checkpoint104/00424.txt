 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and they specifically asked for the language it is written in. My first step should be to detect the language of this input. I have several language detection tools available, and I'll choose one for this initial attempt. I'll use the quick_language_detector tool, which is designed to quickly identify the language and provide a confidence score.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك'

User: The quick_language_detector tool has returned a result. It says the language is Arabic with a confidence score of 0.98. This seems highly confident, so it's likely correct. I'll proceed to confirm this with another tool for added accuracy.

Thought: To ensure the accuracy of the quick_language_detector's result, I'll run the same text through a different language detection API. I'll use the text_language_by_api_ninjas tool, which is another reliable language detection service. This will help cross-verify the result and provide a secondary opinion.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text: 'مرحبا كيف حالك'

User: The text_language_by_api_ninjas tool also confirms that the language is Arabic. This consistent result across two different tools strengthens my confidence in the detection. The next step would be to translate the text or provide further information, but the primary task was simply to identify the language.

Thought: Since the task was to determine the language, and both tools have provided a definitive answer, I can now proceed to wrap up. I'll call the Finish function with the "give_answer" option, providing the detected language as the final answer. This will signal the completion of the task and provide the user with the sought-after information.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the text "مرحبا كيف حالك" is Arabic.'
