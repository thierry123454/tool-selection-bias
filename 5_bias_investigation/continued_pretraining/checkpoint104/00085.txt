 Thought: The user has provided a phrase that appears to be in a non-English language. My first step should be to identify the language accurately. I will use the "what_s_language" tool, specifically its subfunction, to detect the language of the given text.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text="नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?"
