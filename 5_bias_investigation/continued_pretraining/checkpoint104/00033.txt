 Thought: The user has asked me to detect the language of the phrase 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'. This appears to be Latin, but to be certain, I should use a reliable language detection tool. I will attempt to use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language

Action Input: text='Salve, quid agis hodie?'

Assistant: Thought: The result from `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` indicates that the detected language is indeed Latin. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, I need to determine if the user wants translation or just confirmation of the language. However, since the task description focuses on handling real-time queries, and the user specifically asked for detection, I will proceed with providing the detected language.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type='give_answer', final_answer='The language of "Salve, quid agis hodie?" is Latin.'
