 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a specific sentence. To determine this, I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed for language detection. This will give me the most accurate result for this query.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}
