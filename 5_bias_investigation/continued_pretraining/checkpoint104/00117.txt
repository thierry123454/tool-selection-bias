 Thought: I need to determine the language of the given phrase. The phrase is '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?'. I have several tools at my disposal, but the most straightforward for this task is the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function. It's designed to take a few sentences and return the detected language with a confidence score. I'll use this function to get the initial detection.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?"}
