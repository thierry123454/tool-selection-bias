 Thought: The user provided a sentence in Spanish. My first step is to confirm its language using a reliable tool. I'll use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function for this initial detection.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text="Hola, ¿cómo estás?"

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.
