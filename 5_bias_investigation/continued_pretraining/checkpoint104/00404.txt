 Thought: The input text is 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?'. My first step is to confirm the language using a reliable detection tool. I'll use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function, as it is specifically designed for this purpose.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?'
Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function has just returned 'hi' for the language code. This indicates that the text is in Hindi. However, I should verify this with another tool to ensure accuracy, as sometimes language detection can be ambiguous with very short phrases.

Action: `detect_for_translate_all_languages`
Action Input: 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?'
Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has also identified the language as Hindi. This consistent result from two different tools gives me high confidence that the language is indeed Hindi. My task is now complete.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: `{"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the phrase 'नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?' is Hindi."}`
