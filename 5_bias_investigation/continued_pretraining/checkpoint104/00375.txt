 Thought: The user has provided a phrase that appears to be a mix of Hindi and English. My first step should be to confirm the language of the entire phrase to ensure accurate processing or translation. Given the available tools, I should use the language detection capabilities of one of the APIs to identify the dominant language.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {
  "text": "नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?"
}

Assistant: Thought: The API call has returned a result indicating the detected language. I need to analyze this output to proceed. If the language is identified with high confidence, I can move forward with a translation or further processing. If the confidence is low, I might need to consider alternative methods or seek more context.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {
  "text": "नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?"
}

Assistant: Thought: The second API call has also provided a language detection result. I should compare the outputs from both APIs to ensure consistency. If they agree, I can proceed with confidence. If there's a discrepancy, I need to decide which one to trust or consider a fallback strategy.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {
  "text": "नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?"
}

Assistant: Thought: The third API call has confirmed the language detection. Based on the consistent results from the first two calls and this third one, I am confident that the language of the phrase is Hindi. Now that I have confirmed the language, the next logical step is to translate this Hindi phrase into a more widely understood language, such as English, for the user.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {
  "text": "नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?"
}

Assistant: Thought: The language detection from the "translate_all_languages" tool has also confirmed Hindi. With all tools agreeing on the language, I can now proceed with the translation. The user wants to know the language of the phrase, but since it's already confirmed, the next step would typically be to translate it. However, since the task is to determine the language, I should finalize the answer based on the consistent detection results.
