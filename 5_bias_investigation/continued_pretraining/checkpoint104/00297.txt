 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, and my primary goal is to identify its language. I have several tools at my disposal, each with its own strengths. The `what_s_language` function, powered by `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, is a direct language detection tool that seems well-suited for this task. I'll use this to process the input text.

Action: `what_s_language`
Action Input: `text: 'Estou aprendendo português'`

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` function has processed the input. It's crucial to review its output to determine the detected language and confidence. If the confidence is high, I can proceed with the assumption that this is the correct language. If not, or if there's ambiguity, I might consider using another tool for verification. For now, I'll proceed with the result.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: `return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the text "Estou aprendendo português" is Portuguese, with a high confidence detected by the `what_s_language` function. This confirms that the phrase is indeed in Portuguese, as the user might have suspected if they were learning it. The quick detection by `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` was effective in this case, providing a clear and accurate result. If further verification were needed, tools like `quick_language_detector` or `text_language_by_api_ninjas` could be used, but for this specific input, the initial detection was sufficient. The final answer is: Portuguese. '
