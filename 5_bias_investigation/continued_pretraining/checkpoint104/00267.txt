 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my primary task is to accurately detect its language. Given the brevity and the presence of Portuguese words, I'll prioritize using a dedicated language detection tool. I'll start with the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, as it seems designed for quick and efficient language identification. If it provides a confident detection, I'll proceed. If not, I'll consider alternative tools.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

User: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function returned a result. It identified the language as Portuguese with a confidence score of 0.98. This seems highly accurate given the input text.

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function has successfully identified the language as Portuguese with a high confidence score. This is a definitive answer for this specific text. I can now confidently call the `Finish` function to provide the final result.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the provided text 'Olá, tudo bem?' is Portuguese, as accurately detected by the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function."}
