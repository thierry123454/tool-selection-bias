 Thought: The user has provided a short Japanese sentence. My first step should be to accurately detect its language. I'll use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function, which is designed to identify the language with a confidence score. This will give me a clear indication of the language and its certainty.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "今日はとてもいい天気です"}

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` indicates that the text is indeed Japanese, with a very high confidence score. This confirms my initial assumption. Now, I need to present this information to the user in a clear and informative manner.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '今日はとてもいい天気です' is Japanese. The detection was highly confident, confirming that it is indeed Japanese."}
