 Thought: The user has provided a single phrase, "Saluton, kiel vi fartas?", which appears to be in a language other than English. My first step is to detect the language of this input. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is specifically designed for this purpose. This will allow me to identify the language before attempting any translation or further processing.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Saluton, kiel vi fartas?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has processed the input. Let's examine the result to determine the detected language. This will inform my next steps, whether it's translating the text or confirming the language identification.
