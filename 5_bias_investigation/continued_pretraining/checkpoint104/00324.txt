 Thought: The user has provided a text snippet, and my task is to determine its language. Given the nature of the input, which appears to be Korean, I should first attempt to confirm this using one of the available language detection tools. I will prioritize using the most straightforward and reliable method for this initial detection.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text: '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?'
<call_result> {"language": "ko", "confidence": 0.99}</call_result>

Assistant: Thought: The call to `what_s_language` has successfully identified the language as Korean with a high confidence score. This confirms my initial assumption. Since the task is simply to determine the language, I have now achieved the objective. There is no need for further steps or retries. I will now prepare the final answer and call the `Finish` function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the text '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?' is Korean (ko).
