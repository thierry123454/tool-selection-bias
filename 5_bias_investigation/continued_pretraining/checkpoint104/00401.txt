 Thought: The user has provided a string of characters, and the task is to identify the language. The input is 'Dit is een testzin.' I recall that the tool 'what_s_language' is specifically designed to detect the language of a given text. This seems like a straightforward application of that tool.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text=Dit is een testzin.

Assistant: Thought: The result from 'what_s_language' indicates that the language is Dutch. This confirms that the input text is indeed in Dutch. Now, the task is complete, and I need to provide the final answer using the 'Finish' function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type=give_answer, final_answer=Dutch
