 Thought: The user has provided a short text snippet in Korean. My first step is to accurately detect its language. I can use any of the available language detection tools. Given the brevity and the clear Korean script, I'll prioritize a fast and reliable method. I'll use `detect_for_translate_all_languages` as it's designed for quick detection and handles a wide range of languages.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {'text': '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.'}

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates the language as Korean. This is a clear and confident detection. Since the task is solely about language detection, and we've successfully identified it, I can now proceed to confirm this with another tool to ensure accuracy, or simply proceed to the final answer.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {'text': '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.'}

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function also confirms the language as Korean, providing a consistent result. This reinforces my initial detection. Now, I need to decide whether to proceed with a translation or simply confirm the language. Since the user only asked for detection, I'll proceed to the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the text "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다." is Korean.'}
