 Thought: The user has provided a Latin phrase. My first step is to confirm its language using an appropriate tool. I'll use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function for this.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Salve, quid agis hodie?'

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function has processed the input. It's now time to analyze the result and proceed accordingly.

Action: (Based on the function's output, I will proceed to either confirm the language or attempt a translation if the language is unknown or requires further processing.)
