 Thought: The user has provided a text snippet, and my task is to identify its language. The input text is '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?', which appears to be in Spanish. To confirm this, I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed to detect the language of any given text. This function is a reliable choice for this initial step.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {"text": "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?"}
