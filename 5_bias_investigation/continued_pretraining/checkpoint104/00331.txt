 Thought: The user has provided a text, and my task is to identify its language. The text is 'Привет, как дела?'. I recall that there are several language detection tools available, and I need to decide which one to use for this specific task. I'll consider the simplicity and accuracy of each option.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas

Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

User: The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is detected as 'ru' (Russian) with a high confidence score.

Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has successfully identified the language of the provided text as Russian. This is a strong indication that the text is indeed in Russian. However, I should consider if there's a need to confirm this with another tool, especially if the confidence score isn't 100%, but in this case, it seems definitive. My next step would be to confirm this result or proceed with any subsequent task that might depend on this language identification.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian (code: 'ru')."}
