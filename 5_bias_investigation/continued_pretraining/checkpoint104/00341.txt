 Thought: The user has asked for the language of a specific phrase. The phrase 'Ol치, tudo bem?' is clearly in Portuguese. However, to ensure accuracy and to practice using the available tools, I should first confirm the language using one of the detection APIs. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to detect the language, as it seems to be a robust option for language detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {'text': 'Ol치, tudo bem?'}

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the language of 'Ol치, tudo bem?' is indeed Portuguese. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, I need to present this information to the user in a clear and concise manner, as per the instructions to use the `Finish` function at the end of the task.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language detected in the phrase "Ol치, tudo bem?" is Portuguese.'}
