 Thought: The user has provided a text snippet. My initial goal is to accurately identify its language. Given the simplicity and directness of the task, I will proceed with the most straightforward approach available, which is to use the `what_s_language` tool. This tool is designed to detect the language of a given text, and its subfunction `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` is specifically tailored for this purpose. I will feed the text 'Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui' into this function to get a quick result.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text: 'Je suis très heureux aujourd'hui'

Assistant: Thought: The API call to `what_s_language` has just returned a result. I need to analyze this output to determine the detected language and its confidence score. This will be crucial for my next steps, especially if the confidence is low, indicating a need for alternative methods or further verification.

Action: analyze_response
Action Input: response: (the result from the API call, e.g., language code and confidence score)
