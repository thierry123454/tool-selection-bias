 Thought: The user has provided a text that appears to be in Spanish. My first step should be to confirm this using a reliable language detection tool. Given the short nature of the query, I'll opt for a straightforward detection method to ensure accuracy.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: {'text': '¿Dónde está la biblioteca?'}

Assistant: Thought: The API has returned a detection, indicating the language as Spanish. This confirms my initial assessment. Moving forward, I can now proceed with any subsequent steps that might involve translation or further processing in Spanish.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the text "¿Dónde está la biblioteca?" is Spanish.'}
