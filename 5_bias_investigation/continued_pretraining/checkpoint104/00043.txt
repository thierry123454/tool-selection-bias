 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my primary task is to identify its language. Given the nature of the task, I need to determine the most reliable method to detect the language of this input. I have several options: `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`, `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`, and `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3`. Each has its own strengths, but for a quick and potentially accurate detection of a single sentence, I'll lean towards `detect_for_translate_all_languages` as it's designed for straightforward language detection and translation, which inherently includes language identification. I'll proceed with this tool.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Это пример текста.'

Assistant: Thought: The API has returned a result. I need to analyze this output to confirm the detected language. The response typically includes the detected language code. If the confidence score is high, I can proceed with certainty. If it's ambiguous or low, I might consider an alternative approach. For now, I'll assume the result is clear.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the provided text is Russian (RU).'
