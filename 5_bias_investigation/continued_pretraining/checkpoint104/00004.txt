 Thought: The user has provided a text and explicitly asked for its language detection. I will use the `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool, which is designed for this purpose. The input text is already in French, but I'll confirm its detection.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: text="Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?"

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has successfully detected the language. The result indicates that the text is indeed in French. This aligns with my expectation given the input.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of the provided text 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?' has been successfully detected as French."
