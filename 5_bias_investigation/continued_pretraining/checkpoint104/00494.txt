 Thought: The user has provided a sentence, and I need to determine its language. I have several tools available for this, including "what_s_language" and "detect_for_translate_all_languages." I'll start by using "what_s_language" to detect the language.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: The API is processing the input. It should return the detected language code.

Assistant: Thought: The result indicates the language is Russian. Now, I need to confirm this with another tool to ensure accuracy, as sometimes language detection can be ambiguous, especially with short texts or mixed languages. I'll use "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector" for a second opinion.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: The quick language detector also identifies the text as Russian, which confirms my initial detection. Now, I should check if there's a way to translate this text, just to ensure the language detection is correct by seeing the translated output. I'll use "detect_for_translate_all_languages" to detect the language before translation.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: The API confirms the language is indeed Russian. This gives me high confidence that the detection is accurate. Now, I need to provide the final answer to the user, indicating the detected language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the sentence "Привет, как дела?" is Russian.'}
