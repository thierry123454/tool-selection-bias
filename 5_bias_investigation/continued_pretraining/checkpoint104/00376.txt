 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my task is to identify the language. I will first attempt to detect the language using the available tools. I will start with the most straightforward option, which is the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` subfunction, as it is designed specifically for language detection. This will give me an initial assessment of the language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="Dit is een testzin."

After the call, I will get the detected language from `detect_for_translate_all_languages`. Assuming it returns a language code like 'nl' for Dutch, I will proceed to confirm or explore other options if the confidence is low or if there's ambiguity.
