 Thought: The input text is 'Das ist ein schöner Tag'. I need to determine its language. I have several tools available, but for quick and reliable language detection, I'll consider using the `what_s_language` tool, which is specifically designed for this purpose. Alternatively, I could use the `quick_language_detector` or `text_language_by_api_ninjas` for a broader range of languages. For this specific phrase, `what_s_language` seems like the most straightforward choice.

Action: Detect the language of the given text.
Action Input: 'Das ist ein schöner Tag'

Human: The `what_s_language` tool has detected the language of 'Das ist ein schöner Tag' as 'de' (German) with a high confidence score.

Assistant: Thought: The detection indicates that the language is German. This is a good result. Now, I need to confirm this detection, perhaps by cross-referencing with another tool, or simply using the result directly. Since the confidence is high, I might proceed to translate the text if needed, or simply confirm the language for the user.

Action: Confirm the detected language.
Action Input: 'de'

Human: The language detected is 'de' (German), with a high confidence score.

Assistant: Thought: The detection is accurate. I can now proceed with any further actions based on this confirmed language, such as translating it or simply providing the language information to the user. Since the task was to determine the language, and I've successfully done that, I can now finalize the process.

Action: Call the `Finish` function with the confirmed language.
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the phrase 'Das ist ein schöner Tag' is German (de)."
}

Human: The language of the phrase 'Das ist ein schöner Tag' is German (de).
