 Thought: The user has provided a short sentence in Spanish. My first step is to detect the language accurately. I will use the `what_s_language` function, which internally calls the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction, to analyze the input text.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'

Assistant: Thought: The `what_s_language` function has returned the detected language. I will now analyze the result.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?' is Spanish."}
