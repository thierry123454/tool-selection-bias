 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in French. My task is to identify its language. Since we have multiple language detection tools available, I'll first use `detect_for_translate_all_languages` to get a quick and reliable detection. This tool is specifically designed for language detection, and its simplicity makes it a good initial candidate.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text: 'Je suis tr√®s heureux de te voir.'

After the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state. Then you will analyze your status now, then decide what to do next...
