 Thought: The user has provided a text in Cyrillic script, and they explicitly asked for its language. I need to identify the language accurately. Given the available tools, the most direct approach is to use the `what_s_language` function, which has a subfunction `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` designed for this purpose. I'll pass the text directly to it.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language

Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function has processed the input. I now have the detected language. The next step is to confirm its accuracy and prepare the final answer.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' is Russian.
