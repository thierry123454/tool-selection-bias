Given the description of the available tools, the most direct and efficient way to achieve this is by using the `what_s_language` tool, which is specifically designed to "Detect the language of a given text." This tool seems to be the best fit for a straightforward language identification task without needing to translate or perform complex analysis.

Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The detected language of the sentence "This is a sample English sentence." is English.'}
