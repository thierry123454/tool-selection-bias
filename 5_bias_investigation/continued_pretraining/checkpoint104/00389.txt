 Thought:
The user has provided a short Japanese phrase. My first step is to detect the language using one of our available language detection tools. Since the text is quite short, I'll consider the accuracy of each method. I'll start with `what_s_language` using the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction, as it's a straightforward tool for detecting the language of a given text.

Action:
Detect the language of the given text using the `what_s_language` tool.

Action Input:
text: '今日は元気ですか？'

Assistant: Thought:
I've just received the result from the `what_s_language` tool. It indicates that the language detected is Japanese. This seems quite accurate for such a clear and common Japanese phrase. Now, I need to confirm if this is indeed the correct language and if there's any context or further analysis required. However, given the simplicity of the input, this should suffice.

Action:
Confirm the language using the `quick_language_detector` tool as a secondary check, just to ensure consistency.

Action Input:
text: '今日は元気ですか？'

Assistant: Thought:
The `quick_language_detector` has also identified the language as Japanese, with a high confidence score. This reinforces my initial detection. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and both tools have concurred, I can confidently proceed to provide the final answer. There's no need for further translation or analysis at this stage.

Action:
Call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action Input:
return_type: 'give_answer'
final_answer: 'The language of the text "今日は元気ですか？" is Japanese. This has been confirmed by multiple language detection tools, including "what_s_language" and "quick_language_detector."
