 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Korean. My first step should be to accurately detect the language of this input. I have several language detection tools available, and I should choose one that is both reliable and efficient for this task. I'll opt for the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is designed for robust language detection and is part of a well-known translation service.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?"}

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the language is indeed Korean. This confirms my initial assessment. Now that I know the language, the next logical step is to translate this text into a more widely understood language, such as English, for the user's convenience. I will use the `translate_v3` tool for this purpose.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` function has returned 'ko' as the detected language, which is consistent with the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` result. This confirms the language is Korean. I will now proceed with the translation using the `translate_v3` tool, ensuring that the source language is correctly identified as Korean.

Action: translate_v3
Action Input: {"source_language": "ko", "target_language": "en", "text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?"}

Assistant: Thought: The translation from `translate_v3` is "Hello, how are you feeling today?" This is a clear and accurate translation of the original Korean text. The task has been successfully completed by identifying the language and providing the translation. I should now call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer and conclude the task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?' is Korean. Its English translation is 'Hello, how are you feeling today?'"}
