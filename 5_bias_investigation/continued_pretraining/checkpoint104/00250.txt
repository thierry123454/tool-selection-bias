 Thought: The user has provided a text in Russian. My primary task is to accurately detect the language of this input. I have several language detection tools available, each with its own strengths. The "Detect the language of a given text" tool seems straightforward and reliable for this purpose. I'll proceed with that.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

Assistant: Thought: The API has successfully returned the language. The result indicates that the text is indeed in Russian. This confirms my initial assessment. Now, I need to ensure that the user understands the language has been correctly identified. The next step would be to confirm this with the user or proceed with further actions if the task involves translation or other language-specific processing. For now, I'll confirm the detection and prepare for a final response.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Привет, как дела?' has been successfully detected as Russian."}
