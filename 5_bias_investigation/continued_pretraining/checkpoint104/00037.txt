 Thought: The user has provided a Spanish sentence, and my primary goal is to detect its language accurately. I will first try to use the most straightforward and reliable method available to me. My initial plan is to use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` subfunction, as it is described as highly capable and cost-effective for language detection. This function is specifically designed to detect the language from any input text, which aligns perfectly with the user's request.

Action: `detect_for_translate_all_languages`
Action Input: text: 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has successfully detected the language of the input text. The result indicates that the language is Spanish. This is a clear and confident detection, which is exactly what I needed. Given this positive outcome, I can now proceed to confirm the language using another method to ensure consistency and robustness. I will also consider the possibility of using a different tool, just to cross-verify the result, even though the initial detection was strong.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: text: 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function has also confirmed that the language of the input text is Spanish. This consistency across two different tools, both highly capable, gives me a high degree of confidence in the detection. It appears that the initial detection by `detect_for_translate_all_languages` was indeed accurate. Now, I need to consider the next steps. The user's task was simply to detect the language, and I have successfully done so. However, I should ensure that I provide a clear and complete final answer, as per the `Finish` function's requirements.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the input text "Hola, ¿cómo estás?" has been detected as Spanish by multiple reliable methods, including "detect_for_translate_all_languages" and "languagedetection_for_what_s_language." This confirms the text is in Spanish with high confidence.'
