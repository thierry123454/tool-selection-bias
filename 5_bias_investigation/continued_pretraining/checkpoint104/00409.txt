 Thought: The user has provided a text input that appears to be in Korean. My first step is to confirm the language using one of the available language detection tools. I'll try the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed for language detection and is quite straightforward to use.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 만나서 반갑습니다."}

Assistant: Thought: The API has returned a language detection result. I need to analyze this result to proceed. If the detected language is Korean, I might consider using the `translate_all_languages` tool to translate it further if needed, or simply confirm its language. If it's not Korean, I might need to investigate further.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 만나서 반갑습니다."}

Assistant: Thought: The API has confirmed that the text '안녕하세요, 만나서 반갑습니다.' is indeed in Korean. This aligns with my initial assessment. Since the task is to detect the language, and I have a clear confirmation, I can now proceed to finalize the task.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The detected language for the input text '안녕하세요, 만나서 반갑습니다.' is Korean."}
