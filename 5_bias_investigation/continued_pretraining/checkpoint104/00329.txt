 Thought: The user has requested to identify the language of the phrase 'Este es un texto de ejemplo'. To do this accurately, I need to determine the language of the input text. I have several tools available for this purpose, each with its own strengths. I'll first attempt to use the most direct tool for language detection, then consider alternatives if needed.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: text: 'Este es un texto de ejemplo'

Assistant: Thought: The quick language detector has provided a result. I need to review it to confirm the detected language and its confidence score. This will help me decide if I can confidently proceed or if I need to try another method for verification.

Action: (No function call, just analysis of the previous result)

Assistant: Thought: The quick language detector identified the language as Spanish with a high confidence score. This seems accurate, but to ensure robustness, I might want to cross-verify with another tool, especially if the confidence score were lower. However, given the high confidence, I can proceed with this detection.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas

Action Input: text: 'Este es un texto de ejemplo'

Assistant: Thought: The `text_language_by_api_ninjas` tool has also confirmed the language as Spanish. This consistent result across two different tools increases my confidence in the detection. Now, I need to consider if the user expected any translation or further processing, but based on the initial request, it was just to identify the language.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of "Este es un texto de ejemplo" is Spanish, as confirmed by multiple language detection tools.'
