 Thought:
The user has provided a phrase, and the task is to identify its language. The phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?' is clearly in German, but to be thorough, I should confirm this using a reliable language detection tool. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function to analyze the text and confirm its language.

Action:
detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input:
{"text": "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"}
