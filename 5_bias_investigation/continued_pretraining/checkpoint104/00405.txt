 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Cyrillic script. My initial task is to identify the language. Given the brevity and the specific script, I'll first consider using a direct language detection tool. I'll start with the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it's designed for straightforward language identification.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has returned a result. I need to analyze this output to confirm the detected language before proceeding with any translation or further processing.

Action: analyze_result
Action Input: result: (output from `detect_for_translate_all_languages`)

Assistant: Thought: The analysis confirms that the language detected by `detect_for_translate_all_languages` is indeed Russian. This aligns with my initial expectation given the Cyrillic script and common phrases. Now that I've identified the language, I can proceed with the task, which is to provide the language of the text.

Action: call_Finish
Action Input: return_type: 'give_answer', final_answer: 'The language of the text "Привет, как дела?" is Russian.'

Assistant: Thought: The `Finish` function has been called, and the final answer has been provided. This concludes the task.
