 Thought: The user has provided a sentence that appears to be in Russian. My first step should be to confirm its language using a reliable detection tool. I will use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function to analyze the input text.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: 'Привет, как дела?'

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function has returned a result indicating that the text is indeed in Russian. This confirms my initial assumption. Now, the task is complete as we have identified the language. It's time to wrap up.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the provided text is Russian.'}
