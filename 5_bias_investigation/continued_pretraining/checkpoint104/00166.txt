 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my immediate task is to determine its language. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it is specifically designed for language detection and is expected to be reliable for this purpose. This function will take the input text and return the detected language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {'text': 'Olá, tudo bem?'}

User: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint returned: {'language': 'pt', 'confidence': 0.9999999999999999, 'iso6391': 'pt', 'iso6392': 'por'}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has successfully identified the language as Portuguese (pt) with extremely high confidence. This is a definitive result, and there is no need for further analysis or multiple attempts. I will now prepare to provide the final answer using the `Finish` function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the text "Olá, tudo bem?" is Portuguese (pt).'}
