 Thought: The user has provided a sentence, and my task is to identify its language. I have several tools available for language detection, including "text_language_by_api_ninjas," "what_s_language," and "quick_language_detector." I'll start by using the most straightforward one, `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`, as it's specifically designed for this purpose. I'll send the input text 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?' to the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint.

Action: v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas
Action Input: {"text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"}

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has responded. It indicates that the language detected is Spanish. This is a clear and confident result. Since the task is simply to identify the language, and the API has provided a definitive answer, I can now proceed to finalize this.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the sentence 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?' is Spanish."}
