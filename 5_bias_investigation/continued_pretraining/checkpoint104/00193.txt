 Thought: The user has provided a short text, and my immediate task is to identify its language. For this, I will first use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool, which is designed to detect the language of any given text. This is a straightforward initial step, as it provides a quick language identification.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: After calling `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, I will analyze the result to determine the detected language. If the language is identified, I can proceed with further steps if needed. If not, I might consider alternative methods or confirm the input.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

Assistant: Thought: The result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` indicates that the text is in Italian. This is a clear and confident detection. Since the task is simply to detect the language, and we have a definitive answer, I will now proceed to confirm this and prepare to call the `Finish` function with the final answer.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Assistant: Thought: The consistent result from `detect_for_translate_all_languages` confirms that the text 'Ciao, come stai?' is indeed in Italian. There is no ambiguity in this detection, and the task is now complete. I will now call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Ciao, come stai?' is Italian."}
