 Thought: The user has asked to detect the language of a specific text. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function to determine the language with a confidence score. This is a straightforward task and should provide a clear answer.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

User: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint returned the language as Italian with a high confidence score.

Assistant: Thought: The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has successfully identified the language of the input text as Italian. This confirms the initial detection. I will now proceed to confirm this with another tool, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, to ensure consistency.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

User: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tool also confirmed the language as Italian.

Assistant: Thought: Both `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` and `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` have consistently identified the language as Italian. This provides strong evidence for the correctness of the detection. I will now use `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` to cross-verify, as it also provides language detection capabilities.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: {"text": "Ciao, come stai?"}

User: The `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3` tool also detected the language as Italian.

Assistant: Thought: All three language detection tools have independently and consistently identified the language of the input text as Italian. This high degree of agreement reinforces my confidence in the result. The task is now complete, and I can provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Ciao, come stai?' is Italian."}
