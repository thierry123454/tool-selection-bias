 Thought: The user has provided a text snippet that appears to be in Hindi. My first step should be to confirm the language using a reliable detection tool. I will use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function, which is specifically designed for this purpose.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {'text': 'यह एक हिंदी वाक्य है'}

Assistant: Thought: The `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function has returned 'hi' as the detected language. This confirms that the text is indeed in Hindi. Now that I know the language, I can proceed with any subsequent translation or processing steps if required. For now, the primary task was just to identify the language, which I have successfully completed.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the provided text "यह एक हिंदी वाक्य है" is Hindi (language code: hi).'}
