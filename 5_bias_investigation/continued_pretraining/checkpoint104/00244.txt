 Thought: The user has provided a short text snippet. My initial goal is to accurately determine its language. Given the nature of the input, which is clearly in a non-English script, I should leverage a reliable language detection tool. I'll first attempt to use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, which is designed for comprehensive language detection across many languages. If that yields a confident result, I'll proceed. If not, I might consider alternative methods or confirm the detection using another tool.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어떠세요?"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function has successfully identified the language of the input text. The result indicates that the text is indeed Korean. Since the detection was straightforward and confident, there's no need to proceed to alternative methods. I can now confidently provide the answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어떠세요?' is Korean."}
