 Thought: The user has provided a short phrase, and my task is to determine its language. I have several tools available for language detection, but I need to decide which one to use first. I'll start by trying the simplest and most direct method.

Action: text_language_by_api_ninjas

Action Input: text: 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'

Assistant: Thought: I've just received the language detection result for the phrase 'Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?'. The API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint has identified it as German. This seems accurate, but to ensure reliability, I might consider cross-verifying with another tool, especially if the text were longer or more ambiguous. For now, I'll proceed with this initial detection.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: 'The language of the phrase "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?" is German, as detected by the API Ninjas Text Language API endpoint.'
