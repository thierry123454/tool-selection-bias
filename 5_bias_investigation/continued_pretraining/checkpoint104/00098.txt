 Thought: The user has provided a specific sentence, and the task is to detect its language. Given the nature of the sentence, which is clearly Spanish, it seems straightforward. I will use the `what_s_language` tool, specifically the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction, to detect the language of the input text.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: text="Hola, ¿cómo estás hoy?"

Assistant: Thought: I've just called the `what_s_language` tool with the input text. Let's analyze the result to confirm the detected language.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of the sentence 'Hola, ¿cómo estás hoy?' has been successfully detected as Spanish."
