 Thought: I need to determine the language of the provided text. I have several tools available for language detection, including `detect_for_translate_all_languages`, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`, `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`, `v1_textlanguage_for_text_language_by_api_ninjas`, and `fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3`. I'll start by trying the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool, which is quite versatile and can also translate if needed, but for now, I just need detection.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Это тестовое предложение"}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool has successfully detected the language. It returned 'Russian' with a high confidence score. This is a clear and direct result, so I can proceed with this information.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Это тестовое предложение' is **Russian**."}

Assistant: Thought: The task is complete. I've successfully identified the language using the appropriate tool. The final answer is now ready to be presented to the user.
