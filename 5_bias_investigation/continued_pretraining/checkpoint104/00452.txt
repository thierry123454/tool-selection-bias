 Thought: The user has provided a text that appears to be in Russian. My first step is to identify the language of this input. I'll use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function, as it's designed for language detection and is straightforward for this purpose.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="Привет, как дела?"
