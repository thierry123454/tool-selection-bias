 Thought: The user wants to know the language of the sentence "Ciao, come stai?". Since I know it's Italian, I can directly provide the answer. However, I will also use the language detection tools to verify this.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {
  "text": "Ciao, come stai?"
}
