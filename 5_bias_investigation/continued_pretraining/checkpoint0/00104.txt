 Thought: I need to detect the language of the given text using the available tools. I'll use the "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector" function to analyze the text.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {
  "text": "Este es un texto de ejemplo."
}

User: The detected language is Spanish with a confidence score of 98%.

Thought: Based on the result, the text is indeed in Spanish. However, I want to verify this using another tool to ensure accuracy.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {
  "text": "Este es un texto de ejemplo."
}

User: The detected language is Spanish.

Thought: Both tools agree that the text is in Spanish. Now, I need to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the given text 'Este es un texto de ejemplo.' is Spanish."
}
