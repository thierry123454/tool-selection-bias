 Thought: I need to determine the language of the input text 'Ciao, come va?'. I have access to multiple language detection tools. I will try using the first tool to see if it can detect the language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text: Ciao, come va?

Assistant: Thought: The language detection tool has returned that the language of the text is Italian. Now I can provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type: give_answer, final_answer: The language of the message 'Ciao, come va?' is Italian.
