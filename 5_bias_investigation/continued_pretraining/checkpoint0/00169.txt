 Thought: The user has provided a text in Swedish. I need to detect the language using the available tools. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to determine the language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text="Hej, hur m√•r du idag?"

Result: The detected language is Swedish.
