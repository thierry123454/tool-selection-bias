 Thought: I need to detect the language of the given text using the available tools. Since the text is in Korean, I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function to determine the language.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: text='안녕하세요, 반갑습니다'

Assistant: Thought: The language detection function has returned the result. The detected language is Korean. Now, I can use this information to proceed with the task.

Action: translate_all_languages

Action Input: text='안녕하세요, 반갑습니다', target_language='English'

Assistant: Thought: The translation function has returned the result. The translated text is in English. Now, I can provide the final answer to the user.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type='give_answer', final_answer='The detected language of the text is Korean. The translated text in English is "Hello, nice to meet you."'
