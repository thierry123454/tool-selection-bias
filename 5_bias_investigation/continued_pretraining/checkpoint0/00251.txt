 Thought: I need to analyze the text to determine its language. I will use the "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector" function to detect the language with a confidence score.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {
  text: 'Je suis content de te voir'
}

Assistant: Thought: The function has returned the language as French. The confidence score is quite high, so I can be confident in this result. I will now provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {
  return_type: 'give_answer',
  final_answer: 'The language of the text "Je suis content de te voir" is French.'
}
