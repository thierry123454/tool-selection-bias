 Thought: The user wants me to detect the language of "Olá, tudo bem com você?" using one of the available tools. I will use the "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector" function to analyze the text.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem com você?"}

User: The language of the text 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' is Portuguese.

Assistant: Thought: The language is detected as Portuguese. Now I need to confirm this result using another tool to ensure accuracy.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem com você?"}

User: The language of the text 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' is Portuguese.

Assistant: Thought: Both tools confirm that the language is Portuguese. I will now provide the final answer using the "Finish" function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' is Portuguese."}

User: The language of the text 'Olá, tudo bem com você?' is Portuguese.
