 Thought: I need to determine the language of the phrase "Olá, tudo bem?" using the available tools. I will use the "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector" function to analyze the phrase.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

Assistant: Thought: The phrase "Olá, tudo bem?" appears to be in Portuguese. I will confirm this using the "detect_for_translate_all_languages" function.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Olá, tudo bem?"}

Assistant: Thought: The language detected is Portuguese. I will now use the "Finish" function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the phrase 'Olá, tudo bem?' is Portuguese."}
