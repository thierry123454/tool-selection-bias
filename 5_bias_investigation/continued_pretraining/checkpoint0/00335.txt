 Thought: The user has provided a Japanese text. I need to determine the language using the available tools. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to detect the language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "今日はとても暑いです。"}

Human: Thought: The language detection has returned the result. The text is in Japanese. Now, I need to confirm this using another tool to ensure accuracy.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "今日はとても暑いです。"}

Assistant: Thought: The second language detection tool has also confirmed that the text is in Japanese. I can now proceed to provide the final answer using the `Finish` function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language used in the text '今日はとても暑いです。' is Japanese."}
