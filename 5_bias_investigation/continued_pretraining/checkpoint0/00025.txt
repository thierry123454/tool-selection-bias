 Thought: The user has provided a text and asked for the language it is written in. I should use the "detect_for_translate_all_languages" function to detect the language of the text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages

Action Input: text="Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?"

Assistant: Thought: The function has returned the detected language as French. This should be the final answer.

Action: Finish

Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The text 'Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?' is written in French."
