 Thought: I need to detect the language of the given text using available tools. I will use the "detect_for_translate_all_languages" function since it detects language effectively.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Привет, как дела?"}

User: The language of the text is Russian.
