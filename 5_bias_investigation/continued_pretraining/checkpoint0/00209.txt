 Thought: I need to determine the language of the input text, which is '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다'. I will use the detect_language_for_quick_language_detector tool to identify the language and its confidence score.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {'text': '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다'}

User: 
Detected language: Korean, confidence score: 99.9%
