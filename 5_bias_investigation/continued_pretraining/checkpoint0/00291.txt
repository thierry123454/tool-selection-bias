 Thought: The user has provided a phrase in Greek and asked for its language. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to determine the language of the text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {"text": "Είναι μια όμορφη μέρα."}

Human: Thought: The language detection function has returned the result. The text is in Greek. Now, I will confirm this result using another language detection tool, `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {"text": "Είναι μια όμορφη μέρα."}

Assistant: Thought: The second language detection tool has also confirmed that the text is in Greek. Now, I will use the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the provided phrase 'Είναι μια όμορφη μέρα.' is Greek."}
