 Thought: The user has provided a short text in Italian. I will use the "languagedetection_for_what_s_language" tool to detect the language.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: Ciao, come stai oggi?

Assistant: Thought: The language detection tool has returned the result. The text is in Italian. Now, I will use the "Finish" function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the input text 'Ciao, come stai oggi?' is Italian."
}
