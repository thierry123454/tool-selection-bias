 Thought: I need to determine the language of the text "Bonjour tout le monde". I will use the `detect_language_for_translate_v3` tool for this purpose.

Action: detect_language_for_translate_v3
Action Input: text="Bonjour tout le monde"

User: The language of the text "Bonjour tout le monde" is French.

Assistant: Thought: The language is French. Now, I will confirm this using the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool to ensure accuracy.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="Bonjour tout le monde"

User: The language of the text "Bonjour tout le monde" is French.

Assistant: Thought: Both tools have confirmed that the text is in French. I will now use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tool to provide the final answer.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text="Bonjour tout le monde"

User: The detected language code for "Bonjour tout le monde" is fr.

Assistant: Thought: The language code is fr, which stands for French. I will now call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The text 'Bonjour tout le monde' is written in French. The detected language code is fr."
