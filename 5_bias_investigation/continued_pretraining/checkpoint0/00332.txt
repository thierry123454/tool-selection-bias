 Thought: The task is to determine the language of the given text. Since the text is in Arabic, I need to use the "detect_for_translate_all_languages" function to identify the language. I will start by detecting the language of the input text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages  
Action Input: {'text': 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟'}

Assistant: Thought: The function call has returned the detected language as Arabic. This confirms that the text is in Arabic. Since the task is complete, I will now provide the final answer using the "Finish" function.

Action: Finish  
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the text "مرحبا كيف حالك؟" is Arabic.'}
