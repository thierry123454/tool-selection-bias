 Thought: I need to detect the language of the provided text using the available tools. I will use the "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector" function to analyze the text.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {
  "text": "مرحبا كيف حالك؟"
}

Thought: The result from the function call will provide me with the detected language. I will analyze the result and decide on the next steps based on the outcome.

Action: None (waiting for the result of the previous function call)
Action Input: None

Assistant: Thought: The function call result indicates that the language of the text is Arabic. Now, I need to confirm this result using another tool to ensure accuracy.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {
  "text": "مرحبا كيف حالك؟"
}

Thought: The result from the second function call should confirm the detected language. If both results match, I can provide the final answer. If they don't match, I will need to investigate further.

Action: None (waiting for the result of the previous function call)
Action Input: None

Assistant: Thought: The second function call also indicates that the language of the text is Arabic. This confirms the result from the first function call. Now, I can provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the text 'مرحبا كيف حالك؟' is Arabic."
}
