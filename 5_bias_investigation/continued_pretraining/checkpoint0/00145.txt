 Thought: I need to determine the language of the given text. I can use the "what_s_language" tool to detect the language. I will call the "languagedetection_for_what_s_language" subfunction with the provided text.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: 
text: Ciao, come stai?

Assistant: Thought: The language detection has been performed. The result shows that the text is in Italian. Now, I can use the "translate_all_languages" tool to translate the text if needed, but since the user only asked for the language, I can proceed to call the "Finish" function with the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: 
return_type: give_answer
final_answer: The language of the text 'Ciao, come stai?' is Italian.
