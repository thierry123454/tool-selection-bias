 Thought: I need to identify the language of the sentence 'Ciao, come stai oggi?'. I will use the 'what_s_language' tool for this purpose.

Action: what_s_language
Action Input: Ciao, come stai oggi?

Human: Thought: The 'what_s_language' tool uses the 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' subfunction to detect the language. I will call this subfunction to identify the language of the given text.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: Ciao, come stai oggi?

Assistant: Thought: The 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' subfunction has detected the language as Italian. Now, I can provide the final answer using the 'Finish' function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: give_answer
Final Answer: The language of the sentence 'Ciao, come stai oggi?' is Italian.
