 Thought: The task is to detect the language of the given text using the available tools. I will use the "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector" function to determine the language.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {
  "text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"
}

Human: Thought: I have successfully detected the language of the text. The language is Spanish. Now, I need to confirm this result using another tool to ensure accuracy.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {
  "text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"
}

Human: Thought: The second tool has also confirmed that the language is Spanish. Therefore, I can provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?' is Spanish."
}
