 Thought: I need to detect the language of the text provided by the user. I will use the "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector" tool to determine the language and its confidence score.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {
  "text": "Olá, tudo bem?"
}

User: The language is detected as Portuguese with a confidence score of 95%.

Thought: The language is detected as Portuguese with a high confidence score. I can now provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Olá, tudo bem?' is Portuguese."
}
