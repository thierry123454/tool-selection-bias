 Thought: The user wants me to identify the language of the given sentence. I will use the "detect" function from the "what_s_language" tool to determine the language.
Action: detect
Action Input: {'text': 'Ciao, come stai oggi?'}

User: The language of the text "Ciao, come stai oggi?" is detected as Italian with a confidence score of 95%.

Thought: The language has been successfully detected as Italian. Now, I need to confirm this result using another tool for verification.
Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {'text': 'Ciao, come stai oggi?', 'detectedcount': 5}

User: The language of the text "Ciao, come stai oggi?" is detected as Italian with a confidence score of 95%.

Thought: The result from both tools is consistent, indicating that the language is indeed Italian. Now, I will provide the final answer.
Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the sentence "Ciao, come stai oggi?" is Italian.'}
