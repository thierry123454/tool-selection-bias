 Thought: The user has provided a Japanese text, and I need to determine its language using the available tools. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to detect the language of the text.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="今日はとてもいい天気です"

Assistant: Thought: The language detection function has returned the result. The text is in Japanese. Now, I can use the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of the text '今日はとてもいい天気です' is Japanese."
