 Thought:  
The input text is in Japanese. I need to confirm the language using the available tools. I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function to analyze the text.

Action:  
detect_language_for_quick_language_detector  
Action Input:  
{text: "今日はいい天気ですね"}

Assistant: Thought:  
The result from the function confirms that the text is in Japanese. I can now proceed with the task.

Action:  
Finish  
Action Input:  
{return_type: "give_answer", final_answer: "The language of the input text '今日はいい天気ですね' is Japanese."}
