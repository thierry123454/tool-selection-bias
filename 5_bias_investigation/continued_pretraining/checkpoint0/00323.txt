 Thought: I need to determine the language of the sentence "Ciao, come stai?". I can use the "translate_v3" tool with the "fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3" subfunction to detect the language.

Action: fast_language_detection_for_translate_v3
Action Input: text=Ciao, come stai?

Assistant: Thought: The language detection result shows that the sentence is in Italian. Now, I can use the "Finish" function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type=give_answer, final_answer=The sentence "Ciao, come stai?" is in Italian.
