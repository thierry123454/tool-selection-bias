 Thought: I need to determine the language of the message 'Ciao, come va?'. I can use the tool 'what_s_language' for this, which detects the language of a given text. I will call the function 'languagedetection_for_what_s_language' with the text as input.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text=Ciao, come va?

Human: Result: The language of the message 'Ciao, come va?' is Italian.

Assistant: Thought: The language of the message is Italian. I can now provide the final answer using the Finish function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type=give_answer, final_answer=The language of the message 'Ciao, come va?' is Italian.
