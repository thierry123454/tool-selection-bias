 Thought: I need to detect the language of the given text. I will use the "detect_for_translate_all_languages" function to determine the language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {'text': '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.'}

Human: Result: The detected language is Korean.

Assistant: Thought: The language of the text is Korean. Now, I need to confirm this using another tool to ensure accuracy.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: {'text': '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.'}

Human: Result: The detected language code is "ko", which stands for Korean.

Assistant: Thought: Both tools have confirmed that the language of the text is Korean. Now, I will use the "Finish" function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the text "안녕하세요, 반갑습니다" is Korean.'}
