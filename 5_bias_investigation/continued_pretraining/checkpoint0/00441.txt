 Thought: The user has provided a text in Korean, and I need to detect the language accurately. I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` function to determine the language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: text="안녕하세요, 만나서 반갑습니다."

Human: Thought: The language detection result is Korean. Now, I will use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function to confirm the language.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text="안녕하세요, 만나서 반갑습니다."

Assistant: Thought: The language detection confirms that the text is in Korean. Now, I will use the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type="give_answer", final_answer="The language of the input text is Korean."
