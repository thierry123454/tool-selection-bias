 Thought: I need to determine the language of the given text. I can use the "detect_for_translate_all_languages" tool to do this.  
Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages  
Action Input: {"text": "今日は良い天気ですね"}  

Result: The detected language is Japanese.  

Thought: The language is detected as Japanese. I can confirm this using another tool for accuracy.  
Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language  
Action Input: {"text": "今日は良い天気ですね"}  

Result: The detected language code is "ja", which stands for Japanese.  

Thought: Both tools confirm that the language is Japanese. I can now provide the final answer.  
Action: Finish  
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '今日は良い天気ですね' is Japanese."}
