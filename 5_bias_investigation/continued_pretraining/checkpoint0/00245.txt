 Thought: To detect the language of the given sentence, I will use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` function. This function is designed to detect the language of a given text and return the detected language code.

Action: `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`
Action Input: {'text': 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'}

Human: Thought: The detected language code is 'es' which means Spanish. Now, I need to verify if this detection is accurate by using another language detection tool, such as `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`, to cross-check the result.

Action: `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`
Action Input: {'text': 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?'}

Assistant: Thought: The language detection result from `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` is also 'es', which confirms that the language of the given sentence is indeed Spanish. Now, I will use the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action: `Finish`
Action Input: {'return_type': 'give_answer', 'final_answer': 'The language of the given sentence "Hola, ¿cómo estás?" is Spanish.'}
