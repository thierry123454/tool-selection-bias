 Thought: To determine the language of the input text "Ciao, come stai?", I will use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function to get a confidence score for the detected language. This will help me identify the correct language with high accuracy.

Action: `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`
Action Input: 
```json
{
  "text": "Ciao, come stai?"
}
```
