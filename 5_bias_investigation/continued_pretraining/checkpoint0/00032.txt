 Thought: I need to determine the language of the given text. I will use the "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector" tool to analyze the text and get a confidence score for the detected language.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {"text": "안녕하세요, 오늘 기분이 어때요?"}

Assistant: Thought: Analyzing the result from the "detect_language_for_quick_language_detector" tool. If the detected language is Korean with a high confidence score, I can proceed with the task. Otherwise, I will consider using another tool for more accurate detection.

Action: If the detected language is Korean, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, use the "detect_for_translate_all_languages" tool for further analysis.
