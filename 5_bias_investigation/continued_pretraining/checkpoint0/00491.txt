 Thought: I need to determine the language of the given text using the available tools. I will start by using the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` tool to analyze the text.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector

Action Input: {
  "text": "Это пример текста."
}

User: {
  "detectedcount": 1,
  "languages": [
    {
      "language": "Russian",
      "confidence": 0.9999999999999999
    }
  ]
}

Thought: The detected language is Russian with a high confidence score. I will now use the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish

Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the given text is Russian."
}
