 Thought:  
I need to determine the language of the phrase "Je suis très heureux." I can use the `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector` function to analyze the text and identify the language.  

Action:  
detect_language_for_quick_language_detector  
Action Input:  
```json  
{text: "Je suis très heureux", detectedcount: 5}  
```  

User:  
Received result from `detect_language_for_quick_language_detector`:  
{"language": "French", "confidence": 0.98}  

Thought:  
The result indicates that the phrase is in French with a high confidence score. I can now confirm this using another tool for verification.  

Action:  
languagedetection_for_what_s_language  
Action Input:  
```json  
{text: "Je suis très heureux"}  
```  

User:  
Received result from `languagedetection_for_what_s_language`:  
{"language_code": "fr"}  

Thought:  
Both tools confirm that the phrase is in French. I can now proceed to provide the final answer.  

Action:  
Finish  
Action Input:  
```json  
{return_type: "give_answer", final_answer: "The phrase 'Je suis très heureux' is in French."}
