 Thought: The user has provided a text and asked me to detect its language. I need to use the `detect_language_for_translate_v3` function from the `translate_v3` tool to determine the language of the text.

Action: detect_language_for_translate_v3
Action Input: text: 'Ol√°, tudo bem?'

Human: Result: The detected language is Portuguese.
