 Thought: The user has provided a text in Italian, and they want to know the language of the text. I will use the `detect` function from the `translate_all_languages` tool to detect the language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: {
  "text": "Ciao, come stai?"
}

Assistant: Thought: The `detect` function has detected the language of the text as Italian. Now, I can provide the final answer to the user.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Ciao, come stai?' is Italian."
}
