 Thought: The user has provided a phrase in Russian. To determine the language, I will use the `detect_language_for_translate_v3` function from the `translate_v3` tool. This function is designed to detect the language of the text and is likely to be accurate.

Action: detect_language_for_translate_v3  
Action Input: text="Мне нравится читать книги."  

Result: The language detected is Russian.
