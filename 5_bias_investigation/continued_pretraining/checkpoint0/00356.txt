 Thought:  
The user wants me to detect the language of the provided text. The text appears to be in Hebrew. I will use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` tool to confirm this.

Action:  
languagedetection_for_what_s_language  
Action Input:  
text: 'שלום, מה שלומך היום?'  

Action Result:  
The detected language is Hebrew.  

Thought:  
The language is confirmed to be Hebrew. Now, I will use the `detect_for_translate_all_languages` tool to ensure the detection is accurate.  

Action:  
detect_for_translate_all_languages  
Action Input:  
text: 'שלום, מה שלומך היום?'  

Action Result:  
The detected language is Hebrew.  

Thought:  
Both tools agree that the text is in Hebrew. I will now call the `Finish` function to provide the final answer.  

Action:  
Finish  
Action Input:  
return_type: give_answer  
final_answer: The language of the text 'שלום, מה שלומך היום?' is Hebrew.
