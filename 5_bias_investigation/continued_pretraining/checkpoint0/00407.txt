 Thought: I need to detect the language of the given text snippet using the available tools. I will use the "detect_language_for_translate_v3" API to get the language code.

Action: detect_language_for_translate_v3
Action Input: text=안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.

User: Detected language code: ko (Korean)
Thought: The text is in Korean. Now, I will use the "languagedetection_for_what_s_language" API to confirm the language.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text=안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.

User: Detected language code: ko (Korean)
Thought: Both APIs have confirmed that the text is in Korean. Now, I will use the "Finish" function to provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: return_type=give_answer, final_answer="The language of the text snippet '안녕하세요, 반갑습니다.' is Korean (ko)."
