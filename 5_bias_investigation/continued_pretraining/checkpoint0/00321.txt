 Thought: I need to determine the language of the text provided by the user. I will use the "detect" function from the "quick_language_detector" tool to identify the language.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: "今日はお元気ですか？"

Human: Thought: The language detection result indicates that the text is in Japanese. Now, I need to confirm if this is accurate by using another tool that specializes in language detection.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: "今日はお元気ですか？"

Assistant: Thought: Both language detection tools have indicated that the text is in Japanese. To ensure accuracy, I will use the "detect" function from the "translate_all_languages" tool to confirm the language.

Action: detect_for_translate_all_languages
Action Input: "今日はお元気ですか？"

Human: Thought: The language detection result from the "translate_all_languages" tool also confirms that the text is in Japanese. Now, I will provide the final answer using the "Finish" function.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '今日はお元気ですか？' is Japanese."}

Assistant: Thought: The final answer has been provided using the "Finish" function. The task is now complete.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {"return_type": "give_answer", "final_answer": "The language of the text '今日はお元気ですか？' is Japanese."}
