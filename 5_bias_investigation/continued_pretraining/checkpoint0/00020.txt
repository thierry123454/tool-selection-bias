 Thought: I need to detect the language of the text snippet provided by the user. I will use the "languagedetection_for_what_s_language" tool for this purpose.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text="안녕하세요, 반갑습니다."

Human: Result: The detected language code is "ko" (Korean).
