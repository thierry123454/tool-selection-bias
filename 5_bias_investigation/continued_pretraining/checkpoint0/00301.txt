 Thought: The user has provided a sentence in Italian, and I need to identify its language using the available tools. I will use the `languagedetection_for_what_s_language` subfunction for this purpose.

Action: languagedetection_for_what_s_language
Action Input: text="Ciao, come stai oggi?"

Human: Result: {'language_code': 'it', 'confidence': 99.9}

Assistant: Thought: The language of the sentence is identified as Italian with a high confidence score. Now, I need to confirm this result using another tool to ensure accuracy.
