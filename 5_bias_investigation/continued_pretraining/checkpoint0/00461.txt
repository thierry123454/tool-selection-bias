 Thought: I need to determine the language of the input text "Bonjour tout le monde". To do this, I can use the available language detection tools to analyze the text and identify its language.

Action: detect_language_for_quick_language_detector
Action Input: {
  "text": "Bonjour tout le monde",
  "detectedcount": 1
}

Assistant: Thought: Based on the result of the language detection, I can now identify the language of the input text and provide the final answer.

Action: Finish
Action Input: {
  "return_type": "give_answer",
  "final_answer": "The language of the text 'Bonjour tout le monde' is French."
}
